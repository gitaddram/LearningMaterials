It's all unfolding on a popular Chinese social media app called RedNote, or Xiaohongshu (literally translates as Little Red Book), which doesn't have the usual internet firewall that separates China from the rest of the world. It has been drawing self-professedUS \\\"TikTok refugees\\\"seeking a new home on the internet - despite the fact that their own government is seeking a TikTok ban because of national security concerns. Americans now find themselves in direct contact with 300 million Mandarin speakers in China and elsewhere – while in the real world, Beijing is bracing for a tumultuous Trump presidency that could strain its fragile ties with Washington. At the heart of the US ban is the fear that China is using TikTok to spy on Americans. The app has faced accusations that user data is ending up in the hands of the Chinese government - because of a Beijing law that requires local companies to \\\"support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work\\\". TikTok denies this has ever happened, or that it would happen. But the possibility doesn't seem to worry some US users - 700,000 new users have signed on to RedNote in the last two days, making it the most downloaded free app in the US App store. \\\"The reason that our government is telling us that they are banning TikTok is because they're insisting that it's owned by you guys, the Chinese people, government, whatever,\\\" said one new RedNote user, Definitelynotchippy. She goes on to explain why she is on RedNote: \\\"A lot of us are smarter than that though so we decided to piss off our government and download an actual Chinese app. We call that trolling, so in short we're here to spite our government and to learn about China and hang out with you guys.\\\" TikTok, although owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is headquartered in Singapore and says it is run independently. In fact, China's version of TikTok is another app called Douyin. RedNote, on the other hand, is a Chinese company based in Shanghai and among the few social media apps available both in China and outside. So Washington's fears over TikTok would extend to RedNote as well. That's why American users on RedNote are referring to themselves as \\\"Chinese spies\\\" - continuing a TikTok trend where people have been bidding farewell to their \\\"personal Chinese spy\\\" who has allegedly been surveilling them over the years. RedNote is now full of posts where ex-TikTok users are in search of a replacement. One post says: \\\"I'm looking for my Chinese spy. I miss you. Please help me find him.\\\" And Chinese users have answered: \\\"I'm here!\\\" The honest, funny conversations on RedNote may not be what Chinese President Xi Jinping had in mind when he spoke about \\\"strengthening people-to-people cultural exchanges\\\" between China and the US. But that is certainly what is happening as excited Chinese users welcome curious Americans to the app. \\\"You don't even need to travel abroad, you can just talk to foreigners here,\\\" said one Chinese RedNote user in a video that has received more than 6,000 likes. \\\"But it's honestly insane, no-one would have expected that we could meet like this  one day, openly communicate like this.\\\" Food, streaming shows and jobs have been the most popular topics: \\\"Is life in America similar to how it looks on [the US TV show] Friends?\\\" Other Chinese users demanded a \\\"tax\\\" for using the platform - cat photos. \\\"Cat tax from California,\\\" reads one post in response. \\\"Here's my offering - the shorthair is a boy named Bob and the calico is a girl named Marley.\\\" Still others are using the platform to ask Americans for help with their English homework. One post reads: \\\"Dear TikTok refugees, could you please tell me the answer to question 53? Is the answer T (true) or F (false)?\\\" Help came quickly: some 500 people have since answered. The flood of new American users appears to have caught RedNote off guard - reports say the company is hiring English moderators. And others are trying to cash in on RedNote's new-found US stardom as well: language-learning app Duolingo put out a graph showing a 216% jump in its user base, compared to this time last year. RedNote's rising popularity is not guaranteed to last though. There is no reason to assume it won't face blowback for the same reasons as TikTok:  concerns that it could be used by China to spy on Americans. It's unclear how long Beijing would be open to such unfettered exchanges - control of the internet is key to its repressive regime. The irony of the situation was flagged by one Chinese user, who posted: \\\"Don't we have a (fire)wall? How come so many foreigners can enter, when clearly I can't leave?\\\" Typically, Chinese internet users have been unable to directly interact with foreigners. Global platforms like Twitter and Instagram and search engines like Google are blocked in China, though people use VPNs to circumvent these restrictions. Sensitive topics - from history to dissent - or anything seen as critical of China's government and ruling Communist party is swiftly censored. It's unclear how much RedNote is censored - it's largely used by younger and middle-aged women in China, where they share images and videos. It's not like Weibo, another Chinese app, where discussions and airing of grievances is far more common, leading to posts often being taken down. But a handful of new RedNote users say they have already received reports that their posts have violated guidelines, including one who asked in",

And Chinese users keep reminding Americans on the app \\\"not to mention sensitive topics, such as politics, religion and drugs\\\". One Chinese user also advised them to stick to the \\\"One China policy\\\", the diplomatic pillar of the US-China relationship - according to which the US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than Taiwan, the self-governed island Beijing claims as its own. The US government has not commented on RedNote so far, and neither has Beijing. But Chinese state media seems upbeat about it, with Global Times even interviewing a US user who said she would \\\"love to interact with Chinese users\\\". RedNote's American fate is anyone's guess - but for now, at least online, the US-China rivalry is taking a break.

    "content": "{\n    \"title\": \"A million-dollar challenge to crack the script of early Indians\",\n    \"text\": \"Every week, Rajesh PN Rao, a computer scientist, gets emails from people claiming they've cracked an ancient script that has stumped scholars for generations. These self-proclaimed codebreakers - ranging from engineers and IT workers to retirees and tax officers - are mostly from India or of Indian origin living abroad. All of them are convinced they've deciphered the script of the Indus Valley Civilisation, a blend of signs and symbols. \\\"They claim they've solved it and that the 'case is closed',\\\" says Mr Rao, Hwang Endowed Professor at the University of Washington and author of peer-reviewed studies on the Indus script. Adding fuel to the race, MK Stalin, the chief minister of southern India's Tamil Nadu state, recently upped the stakes, announcing a $1m prize for anyone who can crack the code. The Indus, or Harappan, civilisation - one of the world's earliest urban societies - emerged 5,300 years ago in present-day northwest India and Pakistan. Its austere farmers and traders, living in walled, baked-brick cities, thrived for centuries. Since its discovery a century ago, around 2,000 sites have been uncovered across the region. The reasons behind the society's sudden decline remain unclear, with no apparent evidence of war, famine or a natural disaster. But its greatest mystery is its undeciphered script, leaving its language, governance and beliefs shrouded in secrecy. For over a century, experts - linguists, scientists and archaeologists - have tried to crack the Indus script. Theories have linked it to earlyBrahmi scripts, Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages,Sumerian, and even claimed it's just made up of political or religious symbols. Yet, its secrets remain locked away. \\\"The Indus script is perhaps the most important system of writing that is undeciphered,\\\" says Asko Parpola, a leading Indologist. These days, the more popular spectacular theories equate the script with content from Hindu scriptures and attribute spiritual and magical meanings to the inscriptions. Most of these attempts ignore that the script, made up of signs and symbols, mostly appears on stone seals used for trade and commerce, making it unlikely they contain religious or mythological content, according to Mr Rao. There are many challenges to deciphering the Indus script. First, the relatively small number of scripts - about 4,000 of them, almost all on small objects such as seals, pottery and tablets. Then there's the brevity of each script - average length of about five signs or symbols - with no long texts on walls, tablets or upright stone slabs. Consider the commonly found square seals: lines of signs run along their top, with a central animal motif - often a unicorn - and an object beside it, whose meaning remains unknown. There's also no bilingual artefact like theRosetta Stone, which helped scholars decode Egyptian hieroglyphs. Such artefacts contain text in two languages, offering a direct comparison between a known and unknown script. Recent advancements in deciphering the Indus script have used computer science to tackle this ancient enigma. Researchers have used machine learning techniques to analyse the script, trying to identify patterns and structures that could lead to its understanding. Nisha Yadav, a researcher at the Mumbai-based Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), is one of them. In collaboration with scientists like Mr Rao, her work has focused on applying statistical and computational methods to analyse the undeciphered script. Using a digitised data set of Indus signs from the script,  they have found interesting patterns. A caveat: \\\"We still don't know whether the signs are complete words, or part of words or part of sentences,\\\" says Ms Yadav. Ms Yadav and co-researchers found 67 signs that account for 80% of the writing on the script. A sign which looks like a jar with two handles turned out to be the most frequently used sign. Also, the scripts began with a large number of signs and ended with fewer of them. Some sign patterns appear more often than expected. Also, a machine-learning model of the script was created to restore the illegible and damaged texts, paving the way for further research. \\\"Our understanding is that the script is structured and there is an underlying logic in the writing,\\\" says Ms Yadav. To be sure, several ancient scripts remain undeciphered, facing challenges similar to the Indus script. Mr Rao cites scripts likeProto-Elamite(Iran),Linear A(Crete), andEtruscan(Italy), whose underlying language is unknown. Others, likeRongorongo(Easter Island) andZapotec(Mexico), have known languages, \\\"but their symbols remain unclear\\\". The Phaistos Disc from Crete - a mysterious, fired clay disc from the Minoan civilisation - \\\"closely mirrors the Indus script's challenges -  its language is unknown, and only one known example exists\\\". Back in India, it is not entirely clear why Mr Stalin of Tamil Nadu announced a reward for deciphering the script. His announcement followed a new study linking Indus Valley signs to graffiti found in his state. K Rajan and R Sivananthan analysed over 14,000 graffiti-bearing pottery fragments from 140 excavated sites in Tamil Nadu, which included more than 2,000 signs. Many of these signs closely resemble those in the Indus script, with 60% of the signs matching, and over 90% of south Indian graffiti marks having \\\"parallels\\\" with those from the Indus civilisation, the researchers claim. This \\\"suggests a kind of cultural contact\\\" between the Indus Valley and south India, Mr Rajan and Mr Sivananthan say. Many believe Mr Stalin's move to",

But it is one of the slowest rates of growth in decades as the world's second largest economy struggles to shake off a protracted property crisis, high local government debt and youth unemployment. The head of the country's statistics bureau said China's economic achievements in 2024 were \\\"hard won,\\\" after the government launched a slew of stimulus measures late last year. Beijing has rarely missed its growth targets in the past. Experts had broadly predicted this rate of growth. The World Bank said lower borrowing costs and rising exports would mean China could achieve annual growth of 4.9%. Investors, however, are bracing themselves: the threat of President-elect Donald Trump's tariffs on $500bn (£409bn) worth of Chinese goods looms large. Yet that is not all that stands in the way of China achieving its growth targets next year. Business and consumer confidence is low, and the Chinese yuan will continue to weaken as Beijing cuts interest rates in a bid to boost growth. Here are three reasons why Xi has bigger challenges thanTrump's tariffs: There is a growing chorus of warnings that China's economy will slow in 2025. One major driving factor of last year's growth is now at risk: exports. China has relied on manufacturing to help exit the slowdown - so, it has been exporting a record number of electric vehicles, 3D printers and industrial robots. The US, Canada and the European Union have accused China of making too many goods and imposed tariffs on Chinese imports to protect domestic jobs and businesses. Experts say Chinese exporters may now focus on other parts of the world. But those countries are likely to be in emerging markets, which don't have the same levels of demand as North America and Europe. That could impact Chinese businesses that are hoping to expand, in turn hitting suppliers of energy and raw materials. Xi wants to transform China from the world's factory for cheap goods into a high-tech powerhouse by 2035 but it's unclear how manufacturing can continue to be such a big growth driver in the face of rising tariffs. In China, household wealth is largely invested in the property market. Before the real estate crisis, it accounted for almost a third of China's economy - employing millions of people, from builders and developers to cement producers and interior designers. Beijing has implemented a slew of policies to stabilise the property market and the the financial markets watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), has said it will vigorously support reforms. But there are still too many empty homes and commercial properties, and that oversupply continues to force down prices. The property market slump is expected to bottom out this year, but Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs says the downturn will be a \\\"multi-year drag\\\" on China's economic growth. It's already hit spending hard - in the last three months of 2024, household consumption contributed just 29% to China's economic activity, down from 59% before the pandemic. That is one of the reasons Beijing has stepped up exports. It wants to help offset sluggish domestic spending on new cars, luxury items and almost everything else. The government has even introduced programmes likeconsumer goods trade-ins, where people can exchange their washing machines, microwaves and rice cookers. But experts wonder whether these kinds of measures alone are sufficient without addressing deeper issues in the economy. They say people will need more money in their pockets before pre-Covid levels for spending return. \\\"China needs to bring back the animal spirit of the population and we are still far from that,\\\" said Shuang Ding, Chief Economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Bank. \\\"If the private sector starts to invest and innovate that could increase income and the job outlook, and people will have more confidence to consume.\\\" Steep public debt and unemployment have also affected savings and spending. Official figures suggestthe youth jobless rateremains high compared to before the pandemic, and that wage rises have stalled. President Xi has promised to invest in the cutting-edge industries that the government calls \\\"new productive forces\\\". Until now, that has helped China become a leader in goods like renewable energy products such as solar panels and electric vehicle batteries. Last year, China also overtook Japan as the world's biggest car exporter. But the lacklustre economic picture, uncertainty over tariffs and other geopolitical uncertainties mean the appetite of foreign businesses for investment in China is subdued. It's not about foreign or domestic investment - it's that businesses don't see a bright future, said Stephanie Leung from wealth management platform StashAway. \\\"They would like to see a more diversified set of investors coming in.\\\" For all of these reasons, experts believe the measures to support the economy will only partially alleviate the impact of potentialnew US tariffs. Beijing must either undertake big, bold measures or accept that the economy is not going to grow so fast, Goldman Sachs' Chief China Economist Hui Shan wrote in a recent report, adding: \\\"We expect them to choose the former.\\\" \\\"China needs to stabilise property markets and create sufficient jobs to ensure social stability,\\\" Mr Ding from Standard Chartered Bank said. According to researcher China Dissent Monitor,there were more than 900 protests in Chinabetween June and September 2024 led by workers and property owners - 27% more than the same period a year earlier. These sort of social strains as a result of economic grievances and an erosion of wealth will be a concern for the Chinese Communist Party. After all, explosive growth turned China into a global power, and the promise of increased prosperity has largely helped its leaders keep a tight lid on dissent.\",\n    \"images\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1e3a/live/777c",

Doctors had raised the alarm in October, when the baby was admitted to hospital suffering a serious medical episode. After months of investigation, the 34-year-old woman was charged with torture, administering poison, making child exploitation material and fraud. \\\"[There are] no words for how repulsive offences of this nature are,\\\" Queensland Police Det Insp Paul Dalton told reporters on Thursday. Between August and October, detectives say that the woman - from the Sunshine Coast region - gave the child several prescription and pharmacy medicines, without approval.

Police began investigating on 15 October, when the baby was brought into hospital experiencing \\\"severe emotional and physical distress and harm\\\". Tests for unauthorised medicines returned a positive result later in January, they said. However, Insp Dalton said the child was now \\\"safe and doing well\\\". The woman raised A$60,000 (£30,500; $37,300) through GoFundMe donations - which the site is attempting to repay, Det Insp Dalton said.

What does his time in London tell us? Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013. He had previously worked at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, and served as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank. He took over there in 2008, a few months before the peak of the Great Financial Crisis - and his success in that role paved the way for a move to London. He had long-standing connections with the UK, having studied for two degrees at Oxford University and married an English woman. In his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the Bank worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority. He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor. In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions. Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \\\"forward guidance\\\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%. Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \\\"unreliable boyfriend\\\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down. Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums. In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound. Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession. He addressed the nation shortly after David Cameron resigned as prime minister in the wake of the leave vote, in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal. He described it as his \\\"toughest day\\\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively. The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy. His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \\\"should be temporary\\\". His time at the Bank also gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump, which would be useful if he becomes prime minister of Canada. From 2011 to 2018 he was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the first Trump presidency. He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump's attempts to disrupt the international order. He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 became a UN Special Envoy for Climate Change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\",\n    \"images\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/993c/live/d2c8d880-d468-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Reuters Mark Carney, in an open collared blue shirt and suit jacket, with a slight smile. \"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2675/live/52d05fa0-d44e-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney stands before a podium with a crowd and a Canadian flag in the background.

Should the Israeli cabinet and government formally approve the agreement, which is yet to happen, the first six-week phase will take effect on 19 January. The deal follows 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian armed group and political movement. The current conflict started when hundreds of Hamas fighters stormed across Israel's southern border on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza. Israel responded with a military campaign, starting with an immediate air bombardment and then a full-scale ground invasion launched on 27 October. Since then, Israel has attacked targets across Gaza by land, sea and air, while Hamas has attacked Israel with rockets.   More than 46,700 people - the majority of them civilians - have been killed by Israel's attacks, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Here is a reminder of the key events in negotiations. 2023 7 October:Hundreds of Hamas-led gunmen launch an unprecedented attack on southern Israel, bursting through the border fence and targeting nearby communities, police stations and army bases. About 1,200 people are killed and 251 hostages taken back to Gaza. Hamas also fires thousands of rockets into Israel. The Israeli military immediately responds with air and artillery strikes on Gaza. 27 October:Israel launches a ground invasion of Gaza. Israel's massive military campaign will go on to devastate Gaza, displace most of the 2.3 million population, and kill more than 46,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. 21 November:A deal brokered by the US, Qatar and Egypt sees Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails during a week-long ceasefire. Israel and Hamasblame each otherfor causing the collapse of the truce. 28 December:Shuttle diplomacy on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal starts. 2024 31 May:US President Joe Bidenoutlines anIsraeli proposalfor a three-phase ceasefire in return for the release of Israeli hostages. It forms the basis of the deal that is agreed upon eight months later. 10 June:The United Nations Security Councilpasses a resolutionsupporting the ceasefire plan. 31 July:The talks are suspendedfollowing Israel's assassinationof Hamas political leader and chief negotiator Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital, Tehran.

The truck company will also be banned from exporting its diesel engines to the country for five years. It comes after Hino was charged with fraud in a Detroit court for selling 105,000 illegal engines in the US between 2010 and 2022. The settlement still requires approval by a US court. According to the US Justice Department, Hino submitted \\\"false and fraudulent\\\" emission testing and fuel consumption data in a \\\"criminal conspiracy\\\" that allowed it to import and sell its engines in the United States. \\\"Hino Motors engaged in a years-long scheme to alter and fabricate emissions data in order to get a leg up over its competitors and boost their bottom-line,\\\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \\\"To further this fraudulent scheme, Hino violated laws and regulations intended to protect American's health and the environment.\\\" On top of the five-year diesel engine import ban, Hino has also committed to a compliance and ethics plan during that period. \\\"We take this resolution seriously and will ensure that the field fix, the Environmental Mitigation Program, and further strengthening of our compliance system ... are implemented,\\\" said Satoshi Ogiso, Hino's chief executive and president in a statement. \\\"We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers and stakeholders.\\\" The US Environmental Protection Agency said Hino has also agreed to recall some infringing heavy-duty trucks and to replace marine and locomotive engines across the country to offset excess air emissions. In order to cover costs resulting from its legal problems, Hino said that in its second quarter financial results announced in October, it reported an extraordinary loss of 230 billion yen (£1.2bn, $1.48bn). In the last decade, several car makers admitted to lying about the emissions produced by their diesel engines. In what has become known as the dieselgate scandal, brands throughout the Volkswagen corporate empire were implicated, including Audi, Porsche, Seat and Skoda as well as Volkswagen itself. Volkswagen has spent more than 30 billion euros (£25bn, $30.9bn) paying fines, issuing recalls and compensating its customers.\",\n    \"images\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5472/live/7dfc4d80-d46f-11ef-bc87-3f424336a1cd.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"The truck company will also be banned from importing its diesel engines into the US for five years\",\n            \"altText\": \"Getty Images Logo of Hino Motors.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1e3a/live/777c5e90-d3b7-11ef-9da7-c1c79bfc6e92.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"US President Donald Trump, right, and Xi Jinping, China's president, greet attendees waving American and Chinese national flags during a welcome ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, on Thursday, 9 November, 2017\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/75c2/live/8dcfc4c0-d321-11ef-9bab-e1537b3d246b.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Farmer Sandra Noemi Bucu Saz smiles at the camera as she stands in front of her plot of land\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/82d8/live/2dccf420-ccdd-11ef-9f81-4d65801d86b1.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"A girl entering a CT scanning machine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/095b/live/b6dbea60-d407-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Young Danes cycling in Copenhagen\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4328/live/06f21490-d2d5-11ef-a2cb-8929c6f038f8.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Elon Musk arrives on Capitol Hill on 5 December, 2024 in Washington, DC.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",

Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous. Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people. But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about. On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \\\"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\\\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \\\"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\\\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \\\"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\\\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \\\"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\\\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \\\"It was always very vibrant.\\\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \\\"nobody thought twice about who he was\\\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \\\"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\\\" he said. \\\"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas. \\\"Then they would all just muck in and spray these things that were invented. \\\"It wasn't more Banksy than the young people, it was definitely a kind of 50/50 thing.\\\" And how much did it cost to bring in Banksy? \\\"For the first one [workshop], I think we paid him £50. Probably only covered the cost of the spray paints back then,\\\" Peter said. \\\"I don't think he's ever been in it for the money. It shows what a deep, kind and caring person he is.\\\" The murals Banksy created with the children were fun and vivid in colour – but with meaning. Cows looking up as bombs are dropped above them, which Peter believes was a nod to climate anxiety, while another was more obscure - a circus overrun by robots. But what happened to these murals? They were painted over. Again and again. \\\"I personally painted over a Banksy. I threw a Banksy stencil away when I was clearing up,\\\" Peter said. But he is not one to get sentimental about preserving street art. \\\"I have no regrets at all [covering them up]. Back then, it was much more about working with and engaging young people. \\\"And it was just another art project back then.\\\" For Peter, the value of Banky's time at the club is not monetary, but based on what these murals did for the community. He wonders if the children remember creating pieces with a man who is now one of the most famous artists in the world. \\\"I'm very proud he came here,\\\" he said. \\\"There will be [those who were] young people in the local community who are parents now who worked with Banksy, and they may not know that.\\\" Follow BBC Bristol onFacebook,XandInstagram.

    "content": "{\n    \"title\": \"Planet-warming gas levels rose more than ever in 2024\",\n    \"text\": \"Levels of the most significant planet-warming gas in our atmosphere rose more quickly than ever previously recorded last year, scientists say, leaving a key global climate target hanging by a thread. Concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) are now more than 50% higher than before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels. Last year, fossil fuel emissions were at record highs, while the natural world struggled to absorb as much CO2 due to factors including wildfires and drought, so more accumulated in the atmosphere. The rapid increase in CO2 is \\\"incompatible\\\" with the international pledge to try to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the Met Office says. This was the ambitious goal agreed by nearly 200 countries at a landmark UN meeting in Paris in 2015, with the hope of avoiding some of the worst impacts of climate change. Last week it was confirmed that2024 was the hottest year on record, and the first calendar year in which annual average temperatures were higher than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. This did not break the Paris goal, which refers to a longer-term average over decades, but continued increases to atmospheric CO2 effectively consign the world to doing so. \\\"Limiting global warming to 1.5C would require the CO2 rise to be slowing, but in reality the opposite is happening,\\\" says Richard Betts of the Met Office. The long-term CO2 increase is unquestionably due to human activities, mainly through burning coal, oil and gas, and cutting down forests. Records of the Earth's climate in the distant past from ice cores and marine sediments show that CO2 levels are currently at their highest in at least two million years, according to the UN. But the rise varies from year to year, thanks to differences in how the natural world absorbs carbon, as well as fluctuations in humanity's emissions. Last year, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels reached new highs, according to preliminary data from the Global Carbon Project team. There were also the effects of thenatural El Niño phenomenon- where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become unusually warm, affecting weather patterns. The natural world has absorbed roughly half of humanity's CO2 emissions, for example through extra plant growth and more of the gas being dissolved in the ocean. But that extra blast of heat from El Niño against the background of climate change meant natural carbon sinks on land did not take up as much CO2 as usual last year. Rampant wildfires, including in regions not usually affected by El Niño, also released extra CO2. \\\"Even without the boost from El Niño last year, the CO2 rise driven by fossil fuel burning and deforestation would now be outpacing the [UN climate body] IPCC's 1.5C scenarios,\\\" says Prof Betts. These factors meant that between 2023 and 2024 CO2 levels increased by nearly 3.6 parts per million (ppm) molecules of air to a new high of more than 424ppm. This is a record yearly increase since atmospheric measurements were first taken at the remote Mauna Loa research station in Hawaii in 1958. Perched high on the side of a volcano in the Pacific Ocean, the station's remote location away from major pollution sources makes it ideally suited to monitoring global CO2 levels. \\\"These latest results further confirm that we are moving into uncharted territory faster than ever as the rise continues to accelerate,\\\" says Prof Ralph Keeling, who leads the measurement programme at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the US. The record increase adds to concerns that the natural world may become less able to absorb planet-warming gases in the long-term. The Arctic tundra is being transformed into an overall source of CO2, thanks to warming and frequent fires, according to the US science group NOAA. Theability of the Amazon rainforest to absorb CO2is also being hit by drought, wildfires and deliberate deforestation. \\\"It's an open question, but it's something we need to keep a close eye on and look at very carefully,\\\" Prof Betts tells the BBC. The Met Office predicts the increase in CO2 concentration in 2025 will be less extreme than 2024, but still significantly off-track to meet the 1.5C target. La Niña conditions – where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean are cooler than normal - have replaced El Niño, which tends to allow the natural world to take up more CO2. \\\"While there may be a temporary respite with slightly cooler temperatures, warming will resume because CO2 is still building up in the atmosphere,\\\" Prof Betts says.\",\n    \"images\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/264e/live/271569a0-d458-11ef-a6f4-23ba91a24e49.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"Parts of India smouldered in a blistering heatwave in June during the world's hottest year on record\",\n            \"altText\": \"AFP Two shirtless boys cool off under a water tap in India, the boy in the foreground has his eyes shut as a torrent of water splashes onto his head.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96b2/live/ceed61f0-d43a-11ef-9fd6-0be88a764111.png.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Line graph showing rising CO2 levels since 1958.

The tech giant had been facing mounting pressure to withdraw the service, which sent notifications that appeared to come from within news organisations' apps. \\\"We are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update,\\\" an Apple spokesperson said. The BBC was among the groups to complain, after an alert generated by Apple's AI falsely told some readers that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had shot himself. The feature had also inaccurately summarised headlines from the New York Times and the Washington Post, according to reports from journalists and others on social media. Media outlets and press groups had pushed the company to pull back, warning that the feature was not ready and that AI-generated errors were adding to issues of misinformation and falling trust in news. But Apple had previously promised only a software update that would clarify the role of AI in creating the summaries, which were optional and only available to readers with the latest iPhones. This decision disables the feature entirely for news and entertainment apps. \\\"With the latest beta software releases of iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and macOS Sequoia 15.3, Notification summaries for the News & Entertainment category will be temporarily unavailable,\\\" an Apple spokesperson said. The company said that for other apps the AI-generated summaries of app alerts will appear using italicised text. \\\"We're pleased that Apple has listened to our concerns and is pausing the summarisation feature for news,\\\" a BBC spokesperson said. \\\"We look forward to working with them constructively on next steps. Our priority is the accuracy of the news we deliver to audiences which is essential to building and maintaining trust.\\\" Apple had said the feature, which rolled out to users in the UK in December, was intended to make customers' lives more efficient. It groups together and rewrites previews of multiple recent app notifications into a single alert on users' lock screens. The decision comes as the company faces pressure to show its AI developments, which investors had been hoping would drive a new wave of demand for iPhones and other technology. The company's shares fell more than 4% in trading on Thursday after reports sales were struggling in China.\",\n    \"images\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0229/live/240128f0-d451-11ef-9648-d100815d1dd7.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Getty Images Apple iPhone 16 is seen in the store in Krakow, Poland on September 26, 2024\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/edf5/live/ece27fe0-d29d-11ef-9108-d56750e10430.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Adam Trimingham - a man in a blue shirt and tie polishes a yellow bus with his name on the front\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4665/live/9e7b5780-d15a-11ef-b434-bdbe98834795.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, speaking at an an event at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California, US.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b089/live/cba87410-cd7f-11ef-89ae-9b4fd12469fa.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"A screenshot of Mukesh Chandrakar presenting on his channel, Bastar Junction\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0edd/live/249b1040-cd04-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"A person holds an iphone.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8492/live/17c4e920-c9e1-11ef-9fd6-0be88a764111.png.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Woman holding an iPhone\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",

A statement from Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said that, \\\"especially since [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine, we have seen that drones are being used more and more frequently, which poses an increasing challenge for the police and their current technology\\\". Russia is suspected of launching a \\\"shadow war\\\" against Western countries supporting Ukraine - a charge it denies. This has included alleged attempts to blow up international airliners, attack infrastructure - or interfere with democratic elections. \\\"I can only confirm that Russia planned acts of air terror, not just against Poland but against airlines across the globe,\\\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Wednesday. He did not give any details, but his statement appeared to be confirmation of a New York Times report that US President Joe Biden had warned Putin over the alleged plans. In November, Polish prosecutors said a series of parcel fires targeting courier companies in Europewere dry runs by groups aiming to sabotaging flights to the US and Canada. Tusk was hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw, a day after Nato announced a new mission to increase the surveillance of ships in the Baltic Sea after critical undersea cables were damaged or severed last year. Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. There have been several instances of unidentified drones flying over military bases recently. At least 10 such drones had been seen flying above Manching Air Base near the city of Ingolstadt on Sunday evening, German police said. Last month, there were sightings at Manching and nearby Neuburg an der Donau. Drones were also spotted at the US air base at Ramstein and at an industrial zone near it in the North Sea. In her statement, Interior Minister Faeser said \\\"espionage or sabotage are regularly considered as a possible reason\\\". Under the current rules, the German Army can only help police to force drones to move away or to land - but also to fire warning shots to make this happen. Under the new proposals - which still need parliamentary approval - soldiers may shoot a drone down if they think that is the only way to deal with the danger it poses \\\"against the lives of people or against a critical facility\\\". In November, Polish prosecutors said that a series of parcel fires targeting courier companies in Poland, Germany and the UK were dry runs aimed at sabotaging flights to the US and Canada. Western security officials believe that they were part of an orchestrated campaign by Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU. Russia denies being behind acts of sabotage. But it is suspected to have been behind other attacks on warehouses and railway networks in EU member states this year, including in Sweden and in the Czech Republic.\",\n    \"images\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0c10/live/1ae27d70-d350-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Getty Images A drone flying in the sky\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1a39/live/957a6350-d421-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.png.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"A white and yellow propeller plane with the words Aurigny sits in a hanger.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1409C/production/_110367028_gettyimages-89180430.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Hungarian Jews arriving at Auschwitz in June 1944\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2bf4/live/01805fa0-d341-11ef-b9f3-e14aef98374b.png.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"a rocket blasting off from a launch pad surrounded by clouds\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/187f/live/1075f390-d2af-11ef-84aa-b794ba079f5a.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Light blue PVC hangars, akin to large industrial tents.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97cd/live/0eaf0db0-d298-11ef-b526-d36fb212fcf8.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"A plane lands at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport  in Phoenix, Arizona\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",

    "content": "{\n    \"title\": \"What happens if TikTok is banned?\",\n    \"text\": \"TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts alast ditch legal bid fromits Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional. But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it? Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he is opposed to, even if the courts uphold it? TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew will certainly hope so - the BBC's US partnerCBS is reportinghe will attend Trump's inauguration alongside former presidents and family members on 20 January. And whatever happens to the social media platform, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future? The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region. US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force. That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones. Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable. Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target. Of course, there are ways around such a ban. There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region. The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements. It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \\\"internet hosting services\\\" from giving people access to the app. So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to. There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether. And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country. It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so. TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \\\"go dark\\\" in the US unless it rules in its favour. The complexity of the issue means even the experts are unclear about what happens next. Professor Milton L. Mueller of the Georgia Institute of Technology - who filed a legal brief in support of TikTok - said a lack of clarity around how far the US could extend its authority to enforce the law makes knowing what technically happens if a ban goes ahead difficult to determine. But he said what was clear was the impact it would have on users and the internet itself. \\\"It would totally legitimise the fragmentation of the internet along national or jurisdictional boundaries,\\\" he said. Trump has been clear he is against the law - which would come into force the day before he returns to office - asking the Supreme Court to delay its implementation while he seeks a \\\"political solution.\\\" His incoming national security advised Mike Waltz told Fox News the president-elect was looking for ways to \\\"preserve\\\" TikTok regardless of the court's ruling, saying Americans' access to the platform and their data would be preserved. The precise mechanism for doing that is unclear, though -according to the Washington Post- one option under consideration is for Trump to sign an executive order which would suspend the enforcement the law. \\\"I don't want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we're going to create the space to put that deal in place,\\\" Mr Waltz said. Another option would be for Trump to allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice not to enforce it. The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google that they won't be punished for continuing to allow access to TikTok, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant. Obviously, the firms might be uncomfortable about breaking the law even if they've been told it's fine - as it would be effectively requiring them to take the president's word for it that they won't face punishment. Up until now, ByteDance has been resolute that no sale of its prize asset in the US is on the table. But could that change if it is actually banned - and when a president who prides himself on \\\"the art of the deal\\\" returns to the White House? Potential buyers continue to line up - withBloomberg News reporting on Tuesdaythat the firm was looking at a sale to billionaire Elon Musk, thoughTikTok has since described thisas \\\"pure fiction\\\".

Potential buyers continue to line up - withBloomberg News reporting on Tuesdaythat the firm was looking at a sale to billionaire Elon Musk, thoughTikTok has since described thisas \\\"pure fiction\\\". Trump's former treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt are among those who have previously expressed an interest in  buying it. Mr McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said he had secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok. There is an even more leftfield - and considerably less serious - proposed owner. The biggest YouTuber in the world MrBeasthas claimed he's now in the running to make a dealafter he had billionaires reaching out to him about it. Though it may seem like a joke, he has a significant financial incentive to try and save the app - MrBeast has more than 100m followers on TikTok. TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US who, on average, spent 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024. Ban TikTok or make it less usable and that creates a huge opportunity for its big tech rivals says Jasmine Enberg, analyst at Insider Intelligence. \\\"Meta-owned Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, owned by Google, are the most natural fits for displaced users, creators, and advertisers,\\\" she says. Facebook could benefit too, though Ms Enberg says, in common with all Meta platforms,the controversial policy changesannounced by boss Mark Zuckerberg could potentially lessen its appeal. Users bring advertisers - so a ban could be a big financial boost to those platforms. \\\"Chief Marketing Officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok - this is the same behaviour we saw in India when they banned TikTok in 2020\\\", said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering. Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US. Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name on hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though it continues to grow with other content. Other Chinese-owned platforms,such as Xiaohongshu- known as RedNote among its US users - have seen rapid growth in the US and the UK. Still, some suggest no existing app can truly replace TikTok, in particular its feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, and makes a lot of money for US creators. Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3, said there was no direct competitor that people could easily switch to - and notes his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns as late as December.\",\n    \"images\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4b8c/live/8d2a4a10-d32e-11ef-9bab-e1537b3d246b.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"Protestors continue to gather outside the Supreme Court in a last-ditch bid to convince lawmakers to listen to their plight\",\n            \"altText\": \"Getty Images A group of young people holding a sign reading 'Keep TikTok' stand in cold-weather clothes outside the Supreme Court in the US.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a82d/live/343f8870-d32e-11ef-9bab-e1537b3d246b.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Getty Images Donald Trump stands with a neutral expression on his face.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6f30/live/49db4d40-d32e-11ef-9bab-e1537b3d246b.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"TikTok's boss Shou Zi Chew has always refuted the idea of selling off part of the platform\",\n            \"altText\": \"Getty Images Shou Zi Chew wearing a sharp suit with short hair speaking at an event.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dd85/live/99f40c50-d468-11ef-bb39-2f9033d1ecc6.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"The SpaceX 'Starship' rocket takes off from the company's Starbase facility in Texas, USA.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9f5d/live/68323370-d474-11ef-a91c-bf9534ed797e.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Yvette Cooper giving statement from in the House of Commons.

Officials at Elon Musk's company said the upper stage was lost after problems developed after lift-off from Texas on Thursday. But the Super Heavy booster managed to returned to its launchpad as planned, prompting an eruption of applause from ground control teams. The mission came hours after the first flight of the Blue Origin New Glenn rocket system, backed by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos.  The two tech billionaires both want to dominate the space vehicle market. \\\"Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn. Teams will continue to review data from today's flight test to better understand root cause,\\\" SpaceX posted on X. \\\"With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will help us improve Starship's reliability.\\\" Unverified footage shared on social media shows what appears to be the rocket breaking up in flames. And footage showed orange balls of light flying across the sky over the Haitian capital of Port-Au-Prince, leaving a trail of smoke behind. \\\"Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!\\\" Mr Musk posted on X, sharing a video showing a fiery trail streaking though the sky. He also said \\\"improved versions\\\" of the ship and booster were \\\"already waiting for launch\\\". \\\"Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity,\\\" Musk said a short while later, adding that \\\"nothing so far suggests pushing next launch past next month\\\". Footage of the launch clocked up 7.2m views, according to a SpaceX livestream. The Starship system had lifted off from Boca Chica, Texas, at 17:38 EST (22:38 GMT) in the company's seventh test mission. The Starship upper stage separated from its Super Heavy booster nearly four minutes into flight as planned. But then SpaceX Communications Manager Dan Huot reported on a live stream that mission teams had lost contact with the ship. The Super Heavy booster managed to returned to its launchpad roughly seven minutes after lift-off as planned, prompting an eruption of applause from ground control teams. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was aware \\\"an anomaly occurred\\\" during the SpaceX mission. \\\"The FAA briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling. Normal operations have resumed,\\\" it said in a statement. It comes a day after a SpaceX rocket blasted off from Florida carrying two privately constructed lunar landers and a micro rover to the Moon. The uncrewed Falcon 9 launched from the Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday. And Bezos' Blue Origin companysuccessfully launched a rocket into orbitfor the first time. It was a huge step forward for Bezos and his company that has spent years getting to the point of sending a rocket into orbit.\",\n    \"images\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dd85/live/99f40c50-d468-11ef-bb39-2f9033d1ecc6.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"The SpaceX 'Starship' rocket takes off from the company's Starbase facility in Texas\",\n            \"altText\": \"EPA The SpaceX 'Starship' rocket takes off from the company's Starbase facility in Texas, USA.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aafb/live/12d55150-d465-11ef-8ff3-1b4b69bcc516.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Donald Trump's presidential portrait. \"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/562c/live/ca938990-42c2-11ef-9b76-575d2882794d.png.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Black and white photo of Vance at microphone in front of stars and stripes\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6e81/live/4f5f5df0-d410-11ef-9fd6-0be88a764111.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Remains of houses burned by wildfires in Los Angeles\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6e6d/live/17bddaa0-d45d-11ef-a777-d1a42f055885.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Donald Trump and Sylvester Stallone clasp each other's hands on stage at a gala at Mar-a-Lago in November 2024 \"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/493dc650-d442-11ef-93ce-574f8f93dcfa.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Two cans of Zyn on a table, one of them open.

    "content": "{\n    \"title\": \"Netanyahu's office says hostage deal now agreed\",\n    \"text\": \"The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a \\\"deal to release the hostages\\\" has been agreed. Netanyahu had delayed a cabinet vote to approve the Gaza ceasefire deal, due on Thursday, accusing Hamas of seeking last-minute changes to the agreement. On Friday morning his office said Netanyahu had been informed by the negotiating team that agreements on the deal had been reached. He has ordered the political-security cabinet to convene later on Friday and the government \\\"will then convene to approve the deal\\\", Netanyahu's office said. Families of the hostages have been informed, it added. Representatives of Israel, Hamas, the United States, and Qatar have officially signed the deal in Doha, Israeli media reports. The ceasefire dealwas first announced on Wednesdayby mediators the US and Qatar. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani said the agreement would come into effect on Sunday, pending Israeli cabinet approval. At the time, Netanyahu said the deal's final details were still being worked on, but he thanked Biden for \\\"promoting\\\" it. Netanyahu then delayed a cabinet vote to approve the deal on Thursday, accusing Hamas of trying to \\\"extort last minute concessions\\\". Hamas said it was committed to the deal, but the BBC understands it was trying to add some of its members to the list of Palestinian prisoners that would be released under the deal. Although Israeli negotiators have agreed to the deal, which follows months of talks, it cannot be implemented until it is approved by the security cabinet and government. The country's security cabinet and then the government will now need to meet to ratify the agreement. Two hardline right-wing ministers, Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who both oppose the deal, have said they will resign in protest. But they've signalled they will not join the opposition - to bring the government down - yet, so long as the war resumes in six weeks time, when phase one of the ceasefire and hostage release deal ends. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has said he expects the ceasefire to start on Sunday as planned with the release of the first three Israeli hostages. Many Palestinians and Israeli hostages' families celebrated news of the ceasefire after it was first announced. But there was no let up in the war on the ground in Gaza, with Israeli strikes killing more than 80 people since the deal was announced, the Hamas-run health ministry said. Strikes were carried out on 50 targets in Gaza since the deal's announcement, the Israel Defense Forces and the Israeli Security Agency said on Thursday.  The first six-week phase of the deal would see 33 hostages - including women, children and elderly people - exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israeli troops would also withdraw to the east, away from densely populated areas of Gaza. Displaced Palestinians would be able to start returning to their homes and hundreds of aid lorries would be allowed entry to the territory each day. Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and a return to \\\"sustainable calm\\\" - would start on the 16th day. The third and final stage would involve the return of any remaining hostages' bodies and the reconstruction of Gaza - something which could take years. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and others - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 46,788 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

    "content": "{\n    \"title\": \"Mark Carney runs for leader of Canada's Liberal Party\",\n    \"text\": \"After months of speculation about his political ambitions, former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney has announced his run for leader of Canada's governing Liberal Party. Mr Carney formally launched his bid in his hometown of Edmonton, Alberta, on Thursday at a hockey rink where he learned how to skate as a young boy. \\\"I'm doing this because Canada is the best country in the world, but it could still be even better,\\\" Mr Carney said, as he stood before a backdrop of a giant Canadian flag. If he wins, the 59-year-old will succeed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and lead the country into the next general election, which will take place this year. Earlier this month, Trudeau announced his intent to resign after nine years in office once a new Liberal leader is selected. At Thursday's announcement, Mr Carney sought to ground himself to his Canadian roots and distinguish himself from both Trudeau and his opponents across the political aisle. While he has recently served as an economic advisor to Trudeau, Mr Carney is the only candidate in the Liberal Party's leadership race who is not an elected member of Trudeau's government. He has branded himself as an outsider who brings a wealth of financial knowledge to a country that is struggling with a sluggish economy. Under Liberal Party rules, any member of the party - including those who are not elected officials - can run for leadership. They are expected to seek a seat in parliament in the next election, however, which Mr Carney said he intends to do. In his pitch to Canadians, Mr Carney outlined challenges facing the country, like a housing affordability crisis, stagnant wages and the threat of climate change. \\\"Too many people are falling behind,\\\" he said. He also noted the tariff threat from US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday, saying that Canada is facing extraordinary times. Trump has suggested imposing potential 25% tariffs on Canadian goods. \\\"I've helped managed multiple crises and I've helped save two economies,\\\" Mr Carney said. \\\"I know how business works, and I know how to make it work for you.\\\" Mr Carney, who is Harvard and Oxford educated, brings a range of economic experience to the race. He previously worked at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, and served as Canada's central banker, from 2008 - when the country became the first G7 nation to raise interest rates after the financial crisis - to 2013. He then moved to London, where he served as governor of the Bank of England until 2020. During his tenure, he led efforts to support the UK economy through Brexit, though he faced criticism that some of his early interventions were overly political. Mr Carney is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 became a UN Special Envoy for Climate Change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change. In recent months, Mr Carney advised Trudeau on economic matters. On Thursday, he criticised the sitting prime minister for his handling of the file. \\\"I know I'm not the only Liberal in Canada who believes that the prime minister and his team let their attention wander from the economy too often,\\\" Mr Carney said. Mr Carney's opponents in the Liberal leadership race include a number of sitting members of parliament. Former finance minister Chrystia Freeland is also expected to announce a bid in the coming days. Freeland resigned from her post in December over a break from Trudeau for his handling of Canada's fiscal matters. Whoever wins the Liberal leadership race will face-off against the opposition Conservatives, who have a strong lead in the polls. Their leader, Pierre Poilievre, has championed a small government and a return to \\\"common sense\\\" politics. Mr Carney called Poilievre's ideas for Canada \\\"naïve\\\" and \\\"dangerous\\\". The Conservatives have sought to link Mr Carney with Trudeau's unpopular government, saying he is \\\"just like Justin\\\". They also note he has been a champion of carbon pricing, which is Trudeau's signature climate policy and has been met with a mixed reaction in Canada. Mr Carney has advocated for a price on carbon, but appeared to recently back away from the policy, telling a Senate committee in May that it has \\\"served a purpose up until now\\\". On Thursday, he said that the carbon tax should be replaced with a policy \\\"that is at least, if not more, effective\\\" on climate without hurting Canadians' bottom line. Liberals are scheduled to elect their next leader on 9 March. The next Canadian general election must be held on or before October of this year, and could come as early as this spring.\",\n    \"images\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2675/live/52d05fa0-d44e-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\",\n            \"altText\": \"Reuters Former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney stands before a podium with a crowd and a Canadian flag in the background.

It comes afterLively filed a legal complaintagainst Baldoni in December, alleging sexual harassment and that he had campaigned to \\\"destroy\\\" her reputation. Now, Baldoni has responded by suing for $400m (£326m) damages on claims of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy, according to US media. Representatives for Lively, Reynolds and their publicist, who is also named in the case, are yet to respond to Baldoni's lawsuit. In the latest step in their bitter legal battle, lawyers for Baldoni, 40, has claimed Lively and her team made a \\\"duplicitous attempt to destroy\\\" him. His attorney Bryan Freedman said the actress and her partners had disseminated \\\"grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media\\\". He also said Lively and her team had \\\"attempted to bulldoze reputations and livelihoods for heinously selfish reasons\\\". The dispute stems from the production of It Ends With Us, which was adapted from a novel about domestic abuse by Colleen Hoover. Released last August, the film was a box office success, bringing in more than $350m (£280m) globally. But it appeared on the press tour that all was not well between the co-stars, who were not pictured on the red carpet together during the premiere in New York, with Baldoni skipping one in London altogether. Four months after the film's launch, Lively filed a legal complaint against Baldoni, accusing him and the boss of his studio Wayfarer of sexual harassment plus \\\"other disturbing behaviour\\\" and a \\\"hostile work environment\\\" on set. Lively's complaint went further, claiming that Baldoni and his crisis management team had deliberately set out to ruin her reputation online. Baldoni's legal team told the BBC at the time the allegations were \\\"categorically false\\\", and said they hired a crisis manager because Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met. Now, Baldoni is alleging in his 179-page complaint that he is not at fault, and that the high-profile battle is \\\"not a case about celebrities sniping at each other in the press\\\". \\\"When plaintiffs have their day in court, the jury will recognise that even the most powerful celebrity cannot bend the truth to her will,\\\" it said.\",\n    \"images\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c064/live/8d0146f0-d42e-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"Justin Baldoni claims Blake Lively and her team made a \\\"duplicitous attempt to destroy\\\" him\",\n            \"altText\": \"Getty Images Picture of Justin Baldoni smiling\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c8c5/live/25f357a0-d433-11ef-9fd6-0be88a764111.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"Blake Lively posed for photos on the red carpet with her husband Ryan Reynolds and co-star Brandon Sklenar, but not Justin Baldoni\",\n            \"altText\": \"Getty Images Three people - Brandon Sklenar, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds - are dressed in formal attire and posing for a photo.

The primetime programme, which aired on Sunday, attracted national attention on interior designer Anne, 53, who thought she was in a relationship with Pitt for a year and a half. She has since told a popular French YouTube show that she was not \\\"crazy or a moron\\\": \\\"I just got played, I admit it, and that's why I came forward, because I am not the only one.\\\" A representative for Pitt told US outlet Entertainment Weekly that it was \\\"awful that scammers take advantage of fans' strong connection with celebrities\\\" and that people shouldn't respond to unsolicited online outreach \\\"especially from actors who have no social media presence.\\\" Hundreds of social media users mocked Anne, who the programme said had lost her life's savings and tried to take her own life three times since the scam came to light. Netflix France put out a post on X advertising \\\"four films with Brad Pitt (for real)\\\", while, in a now-deleted post, Toulouse FC said: \\\"Hi Anne, Brad told us he would be at the stadium on Wednesday... and you?\\\" The club has since apologised for the post. On Tuesday, TF1 said it had pulled the segment on Anne after her testimony had sparked \\\"a wave of harassment\\\" - although the programme can still be found online. In the report, Anne said her ordeal began when she downloaded Instagram in February 2023, when she was still married to a wealthy entrepreneur. She was immediately contacted by someone who said they were Pitt's mother, Jane Etta, who told Anne her son \\\"needed a woman just like her\\\". Somebody purporting to be Pitt got in touch the next day, which set off alarm bells for Anne. \\\"But as someone who isn't very used to social media, I didn't really know what was happening to me,\\\" she said. At one point, \\\"Brad Pitt\\\" said he tried to send her luxury gifts but that he was unable to pay customs on them as his bank accounts were frozendue to his divorce proceedings with actor Angelina Jolie, prompting Anne to transfer €9000 to the scammers. \\\"Like a fool, I paid... Every time I doubted him, he managed to dissipate my doubts,\\\" she said. The requests for money ramped up when the fake Pitt told Anne he needed cash to pay for kidney cancer treatment, sending her multiple AI-generated photos of Brad Pitt in a hospital bed. \\\"I looked those photos up on the internet but couldn't find them so I thought that meant he had taken those selfies just for me,\\\" she said. Meanwhile, Anne and her husband divorced, and she was awarded €775,000 - all of which went to the scammers. \\\"I told myself I was maybe saving a man's life,\\\" Anne said, who is in cancer remission herself. Anne's daughter, now 22, told TF1 she tried to \\\"get her mother to see reason\\\" for over a year but that her mother was too excited. \\\"It hurt to see how naive she was being,\\\" she said. When images appeared in gossip magazines showing the real Brad Pitt with his new girlfriend Ines de Ramon, awakening suspicions in Anne, the scammers sent her an fake news report in which the AI-generated anchor talked about Pitt's \\\"exclusive relationship with one special individual... who goes by the name of Anne.\\\" The video comforted Anne for a short time, but when the real Brad Pitt and Ines de Ramon made their relationship official in June 2024, Anne decided to end things. After scammers tried to get more money out of her under the guise of \\\"Special FBI Agent John Smith,\\\" Anne contacted the police. An investigation is now under way. The TF1 programme said the events left Anne broke, and that she has tried to end her life three times. \\\"Why was I chosen to be hurt this way?,\\\" a tearful Anne said. \\\"These people deserve hell. We need to find those scammers, I beg you - please help me find them.\\\" But in the YouTube interview on Tuesday Anne hit back at TF1, saying it had left out details on her repeated doubts over whether she was talking to the real Brad Pitt, and added that anyone could've fallen for the scam if they were told \\\"words that you never heard from your own husband.\\\" Anne said she was now living with a friend: \\\"My whole life is a small room with some boxes. That's all I have left.\\\" While many online users overwhelmingly mocked Anne, several took her side. \\\"I understand the comic effect but we're talking about a woman in her 50s who got conned by deepfakes and AI which your parents and grandparents would be incapable to spot,\\\" one popular post on X read. An op-ed in newspaper Libération said Anne was a \\\"whistleblower\\\": \\\"Life today is paved with cybertraps... and AI progress will only worsen this scenario.\\\"\",\n    \"images\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/56c8/live/ceeb0b50-d366-11ef-9159-33fc6bbd8ac5.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"\\\"It's awful that scammers take advantage of fans' strong connection with celebrities,\\\" a spokesperson for Brad Pitt said.\",\n            \"altText\": \"Getty Images A headshot of Brad Pitt\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/82d8/live/2dccf420-",

Americans now find themselves in direct contact with 300 million Mandarin speakers in China and elsewhere – while in the real world, Beijing is bracing for a tumultuous Trump presidency that could strain its fragile ties with Washington. At the heart of the US ban is the fear that China is using TikTok to spy on Americans. The app has faced accusations that user data is ending up in the hands of the Chinese government - because of a Beijing law that requires local companies to \\\\\\\"support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work\\\\\\\". TikTok denies this has ever happened, or that it would happen. But the possibility doesn't seem to worry some US users - 700,000 new users have signed on to RedNote in the last two days, making it the most downloaded free app in the US App store. \\\\\\\"The reason that our government is telling us that they are banning TikTok is because they're insisting that it's owned by you guys, the Chinese people, government, whatever,\\\\\\\" said one new RedNote user, Definitelynotchippy. She goes on to explain why she is on RedNote: \\\\\\\"A lot of us are smarter than that though so we decided to piss off our government and download an actual Chinese app. We call that trolling, so in short we're here to spite our government and to learn about China and hang out with you guys.\\\\\\\" TikTok, although owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is headquartered in Singapore and says it is run independently. In fact, China's version of TikTok is another app called Douyin. RedNote, on the other hand, is a Chinese company based in Shanghai and among the few social media apps available both in China and outside. So Washington's fears over TikTok would extend to RedNote as well. That's why American users on RedNote are referring to themselves as \\\\\\\"Chinese spies\\\\\\\" - continuing a TikTok trend where people have been bidding farewell to their \\\\\\\"personal Chinese spy\\\\\\\" who has allegedly been surveilling them over the years. RedNote is now full of posts where ex-TikTok users are in search of a replacement. One post says: \\\\\\\"I'm looking for my Chinese spy. I miss you. Please help me find him.\\\\\\\" And Chinese users have answered: \\\\\\\"I'm here!\\\\\\\" The honest, funny conversations on RedNote may not be what Chinese President Xi Jinping had in mind when he spoke about \\\\\\\"strengthening people-to-people cultural exchanges\\\\\\\" between China and the US. But that is certainly what is happening as excited Chinese users welcome curious Americans to the app. \\\\\\\"You don't even need to travel abroad, you can just talk to foreigners here,\\\\\\\" said one Chinese RedNote user in a video that has received more than 6,000 likes. \\\\\\\"But it's honestly insane, no-one would have expected that we could meet like this  one day, openly communicate like this.\\\\\\\" Food, streaming shows and jobs have been the most popular topics: \\\\\\\"Is life in America similar to how it looks on [the US TV show] Friends?\\\\\\\" Other Chinese users demanded a \\\\\\\"tax\\\\\\\" for using the platform - cat photos. \\\\\\\"Cat tax from California,\\\\\\\" reads one post in response. \\\\\\\"Here's my offering - the shorthair is a boy named Bob and the calico is a girl named Marley.\\\\\\\" Still others are using the platform to ask Americans for help with their English homework. One post reads: \\\\\\\"Dear TikTok refugees, could you please tell me the answer to question 53? Is the answer T (true) or F (false)?\\\\\\\" Help came quickly: some 500 people have since answered. The flood of new American users appears to have caught RedNote off guard - reports say the company is hiring English moderators. And others are trying to cash in on RedNote's new-found US stardom as well: language-learning app Duolingo put out a graph showing a 216% jump in its user base, compared to this time last year. RedNote's rising popularity is not guaranteed to last though. There is no reason to assume it won't face blowback for the same reasons as TikTok:  concerns that it could be used by China to spy on Americans. It's unclear how long Beijing would be open to such unfettered exchanges - control of the internet is key to its repressive regime. The irony of the situation was flagged by one Chinese user, who posted: \\\\\\\"Don't we have a (fire)wall? How come so many foreigners can enter, when clearly I can't leave?\\\\\\\" Typically, Chinese internet users have been unable to directly interact with foreigners. Global platforms like Twitter and Instagram and search engines like Google are blocked in China, though people use VPNs to circumvent these restrictions.

And Chinese users keep reminding Americans on the app \\\\\\\"not to mention sensitive topics, such as politics, religion and drugs\\\\\\\". One Chinese user also advised them to stick to the \\\\\\\"One China policy\\\\\\\", the diplomatic pillar of the US-China relationship - according to which the US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than Taiwan, the self-governed island Beijing claims as its own. The US government has not commented on RedNote so far, and neither has Beijing. But Chinese state media seems upbeat about it, with Global Times even interviewing a US user who said she would \\\\\\\"love to interact with Chinese users\\\\\\\". RedNote's American fate is anyone's guess - but for now, at least online, the US-China rivalry is taking a break.

Adding fuel to the race, MK Stalin, the chief minister of southern India's Tamil Nadu state, recently upped the stakes, announcing a $1m prize for anyone who can crack the code. The Indus, or Harappan, civilisation - one of the world's earliest urban societies - emerged 5,300 years ago in present-day northwest India and Pakistan. Its austere farmers and traders, living in walled, baked-brick cities, thrived for centuries. Since its discovery a century ago, around 2,000 sites have been uncovered across the region. The reasons behind the society's sudden decline remain unclear, with no apparent evidence of war, famine or a natural disaster. But its greatest mystery is its undeciphered script, leaving its language, governance and beliefs shrouded in secrecy. For over a century, experts - linguists, scientists and archaeologists - have tried to crack the Indus script. Theories have linked it to earlyBrahmi scripts, Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages,Sumerian, and even claimed it's just made up of political or religious symbols. Yet, its secrets remain locked away. \\\\\\\"The Indus script is perhaps the most important system of writing that is undeciphered,\\\\\\\" says Asko Parpola, a leading Indologist. These days, the more popular spectacular theories equate the script with content from Hindu scriptures and attribute spiritual and magical meanings to the inscriptions. Most of these attempts ignore that the script, made up of signs and symbols, mostly appears on stone seals used for trade and commerce, making it unlikely they contain religious or mythological content, according to Mr Rao. There are many challenges to deciphering the Indus script. First, the relatively small number of scripts - about 4,000 of them, almost all on small objects such as seals, pottery and tablets. Then there's the brevity of each script - average length of about five signs or symbols - with no long texts on walls, tablets or upright stone slabs. Consider the commonly found square seals: lines of signs run along their top, with a central animal motif - often a unicorn - and an object beside it, whose meaning remains unknown. There's also no bilingual artefact like theRosetta Stone, which helped scholars decode Egyptian hieroglyphs. Such artefacts contain text in two languages, offering a direct comparison between a known and unknown script. Recent advancements in deciphering the Indus script have used computer science to tackle this ancient enigma. Researchers have used machine learning techniques to analyse the script, trying to identify patterns and structures that could lead to its understanding. Nisha Yadav, a researcher at the Mumbai-based Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), is one of them. In collaboration with scientists like Mr Rao, her work has focused on applying statistical and computational methods to analyse the undeciphered script. Using a digitised data set of Indus signs from the script,  they have found interesting patterns. A caveat: \\\\\\\"We still don't know whether the signs are complete words, or part of words or part of sentences,\\\\\\\" says Ms Yadav. Ms Yadav and co-researchers found 67 signs that account for 80% of the writing on the script. A sign which looks like a jar with two handles turned out to be the most frequently used sign. Also, the scripts began with a large number of signs and ended with fewer of them. Some sign patterns appear more often than expected. Also, a machine-learning model of the script was created to restore the illegible and damaged texts, paving the way for further research. \\\\\\\"Our understanding is that the script is structured and there is an underlying logic in the writing,\\\\\\\" says Ms Yadav. To be sure, several ancient scripts remain undeciphered, facing challenges similar to the Indus script. Mr Rao cites scripts likeProto-Elamite(Iran),Linear A(Crete), andEtruscan(Italy), whose underlying language is unknown. Others, likeRongorongo(Easter Island) andZapotec(Mexico), have known languages, \\\\\\\"but their symbols remain unclear\\\\\\\". The Phaistos Disc from Crete - a mysterious, fired clay disc from the Minoan civilisation - \\\\\\\"closely mirrors the Indus script's challenges -  its language is unknown, and only one known example exists\\\\\\\". Back in India, it is not entirely clear why Mr Stalin of Tamil Nadu announced a reward for deciphering the script. His announcement followed a new study linking Indus Valley signs to graffiti found in his state. K Rajan and R Sivananthan analysed over 14,000 graffiti-bearing pottery fragments from 140 excavated sites in Tamil Nadu, which included more than 2,000 signs. Many of these signs closely resemble those in the Indus script, with 60% of the signs matching, and over 90% of south Indian graffiti marks having \\\\\\\"parallels\\\\\\\" with those from the Indus civilisation, the researchers claim. This \\\\\\\"suggests a kind of cultural contact\\\\\\\" between the Indus Valley and south India, Mr Rajan and Mr Sivananthan say.

But it is one of the slowest rates of growth in decades as the world's second largest economy struggles to shake off a protracted property crisis, high local government debt and youth unemployment. The head of the country's statistics bureau said China's economic achievements in 2024 were \\\\\\\"hard won,\\\\\\\" after the government launched a slew of stimulus measures late last year. Beijing has rarely missed its growth targets in the past. Experts had broadly predicted this rate of growth. The World Bank said lower borrowing costs and rising exports would mean China could achieve annual growth of 4.9%. Investors, however, are bracing themselves: the threat of President-elect Donald Trump's tariffs on $500bn (£409bn) worth of Chinese goods looms large. Yet that is not all that stands in the way of China achieving its growth targets next year. Business and consumer confidence is low, and the Chinese yuan will continue to weaken as Beijing cuts interest rates in a bid to boost growth. Here are three reasons why Xi has bigger challenges thanTrump's tariffs: There is a growing chorus of warnings that China's economy will slow in 2025. One major driving factor of last year's growth is now at risk: exports. China has relied on manufacturing to help exit the slowdown - so, it has been exporting a record number of electric vehicles, 3D printers and industrial robots. The US, Canada and the European Union have accused China of making too many goods and imposed tariffs on Chinese imports to protect domestic jobs and businesses. Experts say Chinese exporters may now focus on other parts of the world. But those countries are likely to be in emerging markets, which don't have the same levels of demand as North America and Europe. That could impact Chinese businesses that are hoping to expand, in turn hitting suppliers of energy and raw materials. Xi wants to transform China from the world's factory for cheap goods into a high-tech powerhouse by 2035 but it's unclear how manufacturing can continue to be such a big growth driver in the face of rising tariffs. In China, household wealth is largely invested in the property market. Before the real estate crisis, it accounted for almost a third of China's economy - employing millions of people, from builders and developers to cement producers and interior designers. Beijing has implemented a slew of policies to stabilise the property market and the the financial markets watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), has said it will vigorously support reforms. But there are still too many empty homes and commercial properties, and that oversupply continues to force down prices. The property market slump is expected to bottom out this year, but Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs says the downturn will be a \\\\\\\"multi-year",

Beijing has implemented a slew of policies to stabilise the property market and the the financial markets watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), has said it will vigorously support reforms.

The property market slump is expected to bottom out this year, but Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs says the downturn will be a \\\\\\\"multi-year drag\\\\\\\" on China's economic growth. It's already hit spending hard - in the last three months of 2024, household consumption contributed just 29% to China's economic activity, down from 59% before the pandemic. That is one of the reasons Beijing has stepped up exports. It wants to help offset sluggish domestic spending on new cars, luxury items and almost everything else. The government has even introduced programmes likeconsumer goods trade-ins, where people can exchange their washing machines, microwaves and rice cookers. But experts wonder whether these kinds of measures alone are sufficient without addressing deeper issues in the economy. They say people will need more money in their pockets before pre-Covid levels for spending return. \\\\\\\"China needs to bring back the animal spirit of the population and we are still far from that,\\\\\\\" said Shuang Ding, Chief Economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Bank. \\\\\\\"If the private sector starts to invest and innovate that could increase income and the job outlook, and people will have more confidence to consume.\\\\\\\" Steep public debt and unemployment have also affected savings and spending. Official figures suggestthe youth jobless rateremains high compared to before the pandemic, and that wage rises have stalled. President Xi has promised to invest in the cutting-edge industries that the government calls \\\\\\\"new productive forces\\\\\\\". Until now, that has helped China become a leader in goods like renewable energy products such as solar panels and electric vehicle batteries. Last year, China also overtook Japan as the world's biggest car exporter. But the lacklustre economic picture, uncertainty over tariffs and other geopolitical uncertainties mean the appetite of foreign businesses for investment in China is subdued. It's not about foreign or domestic investment - it's that businesses don't see a bright future, said Stephanie Leung from wealth management platform StashAway. \\\\\\\"They would like to see a more diversified set of investors coming in.\\\\\\\" For all of these reasons, experts believe the measures to support the economy will only partially alleviate the impact of potentialnew US tariffs. Beijing must either undertake big, bold measures or accept that the economy is not going to grow so fast, Goldman Sachs' Chief China Economist Hui Shan wrote in a recent report, adding: \\\\\\\"We expect them to choose the former.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"China needs to stabilise property markets and create sufficient jobs to ensure social stability,\\\\\\\" Mr Ding from Standard Chartered Bank said. According to researcher China Dissent Monitor,there were more than 900 protests in Chinabetween June and September 2024 led by workers and property owners - 27% more than the same period a year earlier.

The Queensland woman claimed she was chronicling her child's battle with a terminal illness on social media, but detectives allege she was drugging the one-year-old and then filming her in \\\\\\\"immense distress and pain\\\\\\\". Doctors had raised the alarm in October, when the baby was admitted to hospital suffering a serious medical episode. After months of investigation, the 34-year-old woman was charged with torture, administering poison, making child exploitation material and fraud. \\\\\\\"[There are] no words for how repulsive offences of this nature are,\\\\\\\" Queensland Police Det Insp Paul Dalton told reporters on Thursday. Between August and October, detectives say that the woman - from the Sunshine Coast region - gave the child several prescription and pharmacy medicines, without approval. She went to great lengths to obtain the unauthorised medications and cover up her behaviour, they alleged, including using leftover medicine for a different person in their house. Police began investigating on 15 October, when the baby was brought into hospital experiencing \\\\\\\"severe emotional and physical distress and harm\\\\\\\". Tests for unauthorised medicines returned a positive result later in January, they said. However, Insp Dalton said the child was now \\\\\\\"safe and doing well\\\\\\\". The woman raised A$60,000 (£30,500; $37,300) through GoFundMe donations - which the site is attempting to repay, Det Insp Dalton said.

What does his time in London tell us? Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013. He had previously worked at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, and served as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank. He took over there in 2008, a few months before the peak of the Great Financial Crisis - and his success in that role paved the way for a move to London. He had long-standing connections with the UK, having studied for two degrees at Oxford University and married an English woman. In his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the Bank worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority. He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor. In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions. Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \\\\\\\"forward guidance\\\\\\\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%. Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \\\\\\\"unreliable boyfriend\\\\\\\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down. Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums. In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound. Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession. He addressed the nation shortly after David Cameron resigned as prime minister in the wake of the leave vote, in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal. He described it as his \\\\\\\"toughest day\\\\\\\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively. The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy. His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \\\\\\\"should be temporary\\\\\\\". His time at the Bank also gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump, which would be useful if he becomes prime minister of Canada. From 2011 to 2018 he was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the first Trump presidency. He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump's attempts to disrupt the international order. He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 became a UN Special Envoy for Climate Change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\\\",\\n    \\\"images\\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/993c/live/d2c8d880-d468-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Reuters Mark Carney, in an open collared blue shirt and suit jacket, with a slight smile. \\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2675/live/52d05fa0-d44e-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney stands before a podium with a crowd and a Canadian flag in the background.

Should the Israeli cabinet and government formally approve the agreement, which is yet to happen, the first six-week phase will take effect on 19 January. The deal follows 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian armed group and political movement. The current conflict started when hundreds of Hamas fighters stormed across Israel's southern border on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza. Israel responded with a military campaign, starting with an immediate air bombardment and then a full-scale ground invasion launched on 27 October. Since then, Israel has attacked targets across Gaza by land, sea and air, while Hamas has attacked Israel with rockets.   More than 46,700 people - the majority of them civilians - have been killed by Israel's attacks, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Here is a reminder of the key events in negotiations. 2023 7 October:Hundreds of Hamas-led gunmen launch an unprecedented attack on southern Israel, bursting through the border fence and targeting nearby communities, police stations and army bases. About 1,200 people are killed and 251 hostages taken back to Gaza. Hamas also fires thousands of rockets into Israel. The Israeli military immediately responds with air and artillery strikes on Gaza. 27 October:Israel launches a ground invasion of Gaza. Israel's massive military campaign will go on to devastate Gaza, displace most of the 2.3 million population, and kill more than 46,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. 21 November:A deal brokered by the US, Qatar and Egypt sees Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails during a week-long ceasefire. Israel and Hamasblame each otherfor causing the collapse of the truce. 28 December:Shuttle diplomacy on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal starts. 2024 31 May:US President Joe Bidenoutlines anIsraeli proposalfor a three-phase ceasefire in return for the release of Israeli hostages.

The truck company will also be banned from exporting its diesel engines to the country for five years. It comes after Hino was charged with fraud in a Detroit court for selling 105,000 illegal engines in the US between 2010 and 2022. The settlement still requires approval by a US court. According to the US Justice Department, Hino submitted \\\\\\\"false and fraudulent\\\\\\\" emission testing and fuel consumption data in a \\\\\\\"criminal conspiracy\\\\\\\" that allowed it to import and sell its engines in the United States. \\\\\\\"Hino Motors engaged in a years-long scheme to alter and fabricate emissions data in order to get a leg up over its competitors and boost their bottom-line,\\\\\\\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \\\\\\\"To further this fraudulent scheme, Hino violated laws and regulations intended to protect American's health and the environment.\\\\\\\" On top of the five-year diesel engine import ban, Hino has also committed to a compliance and ethics plan during that period. \\\\\\\"We take this resolution seriously and will ensure that the field fix, the Environmental Mitigation Program, and further strengthening of our compliance system ... are implemented,\\\\\\\" said Satoshi Ogiso, Hino's chief executive and president in a statement. \\\\\\\"We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers and stakeholders.\\\\\\\" The US Environmental Protection Agency said Hino has also agreed to recall some infringing heavy-duty trucks and to replace marine and locomotive engines across the country to offset excess air emissions. In order to cover costs resulting from its legal problems, Hino said that in its second quarter financial results announced in October, it reported an extraordinary loss of 230 billion yen (£1.2bn, $1.48bn). In the last decade, several car makers admitted to lying about the emissions produced by their diesel engines. In what has become known as the dieselgate scandal, brands throughout the Volkswagen corporate empire were implicated, including Audi, Porsche, Seat and Skoda as well as Volkswagen itself.

Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous. Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people. But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about. On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \\\\\\\"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\\\\\\\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \\\\\\\"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\\\\\\\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \\\\\\\"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\\\\\\\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \\\\\\\"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\\\\\\\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \\\\\\\"It was always very vibrant.\\\\\\\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \\\\\\\"nobody thought twice about who he was\\\\\\\" when he",

The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \\\\\\\"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\\\\\\\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \\\\\\\"It was always very vibrant.\\\\\\\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \\\\\\\"nobody thought twice about who he was\\\\\\\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \\\\\\\"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas. \\\\\\\"Then they would all just muck in and spray these things that were invented. \\\\\\\"It wasn't more Banksy than the young people, it was definitely a kind of 50/50 thing.\\\\\\\" And how much did it cost to bring in Banksy? \\\\\\\"For the first one [workshop], I think we paid him £50. Probably only covered the cost of the spray paints back then,\\\\\\\" Peter said. \\\\\\\"I don't think he's ever been in it for the money. It shows what a deep, kind and caring person he is.\\\\\\\" The murals Banksy created with the children were fun and vivid in colour – but with meaning. Cows looking up as bombs are dropped above them, which Peter believes was a nod to climate anxiety, while another was more obscure - a circus overrun by robots. But what happened to these murals? They were painted over. Again and again. \\\\\\\"I personally painted over a Banksy. I threw a Banksy stencil away when I was clearing up,\\\\\\\" Peter said. But he is not one to get sentimental about preserving street art. \\\\\\\"I have no regrets at all [covering them up]. Back then, it was much more about working with and engaging young people. \\\\\\\"And it was just another art project back then.\\\\\\\" For Peter, the value of Banky's time at the club is not monetary, but based on what these murals did for the community. He wonders if the children remember creating pieces with a man who is now one of the most famous artists in the world. \\\\\\\"I'm very proud he came here,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"There will be [those who were] young people in the local community who are parents now who worked with Banksy, and they may not know that.\\\\\\\" Follow BBC Bristol onFacebook,XandInstagram.

Concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) are now more than 50% higher than before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels. Last year, fossil fuel emissions were at record highs, while the natural world struggled to absorb as much CO2 due to factors including wildfires and drought, so more accumulated in the atmosphere. The rapid increase in CO2 is \\\\\\\"incompatible\\\\\\\" with the international pledge to try to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the Met Office says. This was the ambitious goal agreed by nearly 200 countries at a landmark UN meeting in Paris in 2015, with the hope of avoiding some of the worst impacts of climate change. Last week it was confirmed that2024 was the hottest year on record, and the first calendar year in which annual average temperatures were higher than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. This did not break the Paris goal, which refers to a longer-term average over decades, but continued increases to atmospheric CO2 effectively consign the world to doing so. \\\\\\\"Limiting global warming to 1.5C would require the CO2 rise to be slowing, but in reality the opposite is",

This did not break the Paris goal, which refers to a longer-term average over decades, but continued increases to atmospheric CO2 effectively consign the world to doing so. \\\\\\\"Limiting global warming to 1.5C would require the CO2 rise to be slowing, but in reality the opposite is happening,\\\\\\\" says Richard Betts of the Met Office. The long-term CO2 increase is unquestionably due to human activities, mainly through burning coal, oil and gas, and cutting down forests. Records of the Earth's climate in the distant past from ice cores and marine sediments show that CO2 levels are currently at their highest in at least two million years, according to the UN. But the rise varies from year to year, thanks to differences in how the natural world absorbs carbon, as well as fluctuations in humanity's emissions. Last year, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels reached new highs, according to preliminary data from the Global Carbon Project team. There were also the effects of thenatural El Niño phenomenon- where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become unusually warm, affecting weather patterns. The natural world has absorbed roughly half of humanity's CO2 emissions, for example through extra plant growth and more of the gas being dissolved in the ocean. But that extra blast of heat from El Niño against the background of climate change meant natural carbon sinks on land did not take up as much CO2 as usual last year. Rampant wildfires, including in regions not usually affected by El Niño, also released extra CO2. \\\\\\\"Even without the boost from El Niño last year, the CO2 rise driven by fossil fuel burning and deforestation would now be outpacing the [UN climate body] IPCC's 1.5C scenarios,\\\\\\\" says Prof Betts. These factors meant that between 2023 and 2024 CO2 levels increased by nearly 3.6 parts per million (ppm) molecules of air to a new high of more than 424ppm. This is a record yearly increase since atmospheric measurements were first taken at the remote Mauna Loa research station in Hawaii in 1958. Perched high on the side of a volcano in the Pacific Ocean, the station's remote location away from major pollution sources makes it ideally suited to monitoring global CO2 levels. \\\\\\\"These latest results further confirm that we are moving into uncharted territory faster than ever as the rise continues to accelerate,\\\\\\\" says Prof Ralph Keeling, who leads the measurement programme at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the US. The record increase adds to concerns that the natural world may become less able to absorb planet-warming gases in the long-term. The Arctic tundra is being transformed into an overall source of CO2, thanks to warming and frequent fires, according to the US science group NOAA. Theability of the Amazon rainforest to absorb CO2is also being hit by drought, wildfires and deliberate deforestation. \\\\\\\"It's an open question, but it's something we need to keep a close eye on and look at very carefully,\\\\\\\" Prof Betts tells the BBC. The Met Office predicts the increase in CO2 concentration in 2025 will be less extreme than 2024, but still significantly off-track to meet the 1.5C target. La Niña conditions – where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean are cooler than normal - have replaced El Niño, which tends to allow the natural world to take up more CO2. \\\\\\\"While there may be a temporary respite with slightly cooler temperatures, warming will resume because CO2 is still building up in the atmosphere,\\\\\\\" Prof Betts says.\\\",\\n    \\\"images\\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/264e/live/271569a0-d458-11ef-a6f4-23ba91a24e49.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"Parts of India smouldered in a blistering heatwave in June during the world's hottest year on record\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"AFP Two shirtless boys cool off under a water tap in India, the boy in the foreground has his eyes shut as a torrent of water splashes onto his head.\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96b2/live/ceed61f0-d43a-11ef-9fd6-0be88a764111.png.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Line graph showing rising CO2 levels since 1958.

In November, Polish prosecutors said a series of parcel fires targeting courier companies in Europewere dry runs by groups aiming to sabotaging flights to the US and Canada. Tusk was hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw, a day after Nato announced a new mission to increase the surveillance of ships in the Baltic Sea after critical undersea cables were damaged or severed last year. Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. There have been several instances of unidentified drones flying over military bases recently. At least 10 such drones had been seen flying above Manching Air Base near the city of Ingolstadt on Sunday evening, German police said. Last month, there were sightings at Manching and nearby Neuburg an der Donau. Drones were also spotted at the US air base at Ramstein and at an industrial zone near it in the North Sea. In her statement, Interior Minister Faeser said \\\\\\\"espionage or sabotage are regularly considered as a possible reason\\\\\\\". Under the current rules, the German Army can only help police to force drones to move away or to land - but also to fire warning shots to make this happen. Under the new proposals - which still need parliamentary approval - soldiers may shoot a drone down if they think that is the only way to deal with the danger it poses \\\\\\\"against the lives of people or against a critical facility\\\\\\\". In November, Polish prosecutors said that a series of parcel fires targeting courier companies in Poland, Germany and the UK were dry runs aimed at sabotaging flights to the US and Canada. Western security officials believe that they were part of an orchestrated campaign by Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU. Russia denies being behind acts of sabotage. But it is suspected to have been behind other attacks on warehouses and railway networks in EU member states this year, including in Sweden and in the Czech Republic.\\\",\\n    \\\"images\\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0c10/live/1ae27d70-d350-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Getty Images A drone flying in the sky\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1a39/live/957a6350-d421-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.png.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"A white and yellow propeller plane with the words Aurigny sits in a hanger.\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1409C/production/_110367028_gettyimages-89180430.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Hungarian Jews arriving at Auschwitz in June 1944\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2bf4/live/01805fa0-d341-11ef-b9f3-e14aef98374b.png.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"a rocket blasting off from a launch pad surrounded by clouds\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/187f/live/1075f390-d2af-11ef-84aa-b794ba079f5a.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Light blue PVC hangars, akin to large industrial tents.\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97cd/live/0eaf0db0-d298-11ef-b526-d36fb212fcf8.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"A plane lands at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport  in Phoenix, Arizona\\\"\\n        }\\n    ]\\n}\",\n    \"chunk_order_index\": 0,\n    \"full_doc_id\": \"doc-ad083730fe0b8a40182dbb2a7cdd4417\"\n  },\n  \"chunk-810470126ee6562d1cd52e77e8c7ac55\": {\n    \"tokens\": 1200,\n    \"content\": \"{\\n    \\\"title\\\": \\\"What happens if TikTok is banned?\\\",\\n    \\\"text\\\": \\\"TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts alast ditch legal bid fromits Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional.

Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he is opposed to, even if the courts uphold it? TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew will certainly hope so - the BBC's US partnerCBS is reportinghe will attend Trump's inauguration alongside former presidents and family members on 20 January. And whatever happens to the social media platform, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future? The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region. US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force. That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones. Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable. Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target. Of course, there are ways around such a ban. There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region. The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements. It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \\\\\\\"internet hosting services\\\\\\\" from giving people access to the app. So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to. There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether. And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country. It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so. TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \\\\\\\"go dark\\\\\\\" in the US unless it rules in its favour. The complexity of the issue means even the experts are unclear about what happens next. Professor Milton L. Mueller of the Georgia Institute of Technology - who filed a legal brief in support of TikTok - said a lack of clarity around how far the US could extend its authority to enforce the law makes knowing what technically happens if a ban goes ahead difficult to determine. But he said what was clear was the impact it would have on users and the internet itself. \\\\\\\"It would totally legitimise the fragmentation of the internet along national or jurisdictional boundaries,\\\\\\\" he said. Trump has been clear he is against the law - which would come into force the day before he returns to office - asking the Supreme Court to delay its implementation while he seeks a \\\\\\\"political solution.\\\\\\\" His incoming national security advised Mike Waltz told Fox News the president-elect was looking for ways to \\\\\\\"preserve\\\\\\\" TikTok regardless of the court's ruling, saying Americans' access to the platform and their data would be preserved. The precise mechanism for doing that is unclear, though -according to the Washington Post- one option under consideration is for Trump to sign an executive order which would suspend the enforcement the law. \\\\\\\"I don't want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we're going to create the space to put that deal in place,\\\\\\\" Mr Waltz said. Another option would be for Trump to allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice not to enforce it. The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google that they won't be punished for continuing to allow access to TikTok, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant. Obviously, the firms might be uncomfortable about breaking the law even if they've been told it's fine - as it would be effectively requiring them to take the president's word for it that they won't face punishment. Up until now, ByteDance has been resolute that no sale of its prize asset in the US is on the table. But could that change if it is actually banned - and when a president who prides himself on \\\\\\\"the art of the deal\\\\\\\" returns to the White House?

Mr McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said he had secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok. There is an even more leftfield - and considerably less serious - proposed owner. The biggest YouTuber in the world MrBeasthas claimed he's now in the running to make a dealafter he had billionaires reaching out to him about it. Though it may seem like a joke, he has a significant financial incentive to try and save the app - MrBeast has more than 100m followers on TikTok. TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US who, on average, spent 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024. Ban TikTok or make it less usable and that creates a huge opportunity for its big tech rivals says Jasmine Enberg, analyst at Insider Intelligence. \\\\\\\"Meta-owned Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, owned by Google, are the most natural fits for displaced users, creators, and advertisers,\\\\\\\" she says. Facebook could benefit too, though Ms Enberg says, in common with all Meta platforms,the controversial policy changesannounced by boss Mark Zuckerberg could potentially lessen its appeal. Users bring advertisers - so a ban could be a big financial boost to those platforms. \\\\\\\"Chief Marketing Officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok - this is the same behaviour we saw in India when they banned TikTok in 2020\\\\\\\", said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering. Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US. Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name on hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though it continues to grow with other content. Other Chinese-owned platforms,such as Xiaohongshu- known as RedNote among its US users - have seen rapid growth in the US and the UK. Still, some suggest no existing app can truly replace TikTok, in particular its feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, and makes a lot of money for US creators. Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3, said there was no direct competitor that people could easily switch to - and notes his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns as late as December.\\\",\\n    \\\"images\\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4b8c/live/8d2a4a10-d32e-11ef-9bab-e1537b3d246b.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"Protestors continue to gather outside the Supreme Court in a last-ditch bid to convince lawmakers to listen to their plight\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Getty Images A group of young people holding a sign reading 'Keep TikTok' stand in cold-weather clothes outside the Supreme Court in the US.\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a82d/live/343f8870-d32e-11ef-9bab-e1537b3d246b.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Getty Images Donald Trump stands with a neutral expression on his face.\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6f30/live/49db4d40-d32e-11ef-9bab-e1537b3d246b.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"TikTok's boss Shou Zi Chew has always refuted the idea of selling off part of the platform\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Getty Images Shou Zi Chew wearing a sharp suit with short hair speaking at an event.\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dd85/live/99f40c50-d468-11ef-bb39-2f9033d1ecc6.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"The SpaceX 'Starship' rocket takes off from the company's Starbase facility in Texas, USA",

And footage showed orange balls of light flying across the sky over the Haitian capital of Port-Au-Prince, leaving a trail of smoke behind. \\\\\\\"Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!\\\\\\\" Mr Musk posted on X, sharing a video showing a fiery trail streaking though the sky. He also said \\\\\\\"improved versions\\\\\\\" of the ship and booster were \\\\\\\"already waiting for launch\\\\\\\". \\\\\\\"Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity,\\\\\\\" Musk said a short while later, adding that \\\\\\\"nothing so far suggests pushing next launch past next month\\\\\\\". Footage of the launch clocked up 7.2m views, according to a SpaceX livestream. The Starship system had lifted off from Boca Chica, Texas, at 17:38 EST (22:38 GMT) in the company's seventh test mission. The Starship upper stage separated from its Super Heavy booster nearly four minutes into flight as planned. But then SpaceX Communications Manager Dan Huot reported on a live stream that mission teams had lost contact with the ship. The Super Heavy booster managed to returned to its launchpad roughly seven minutes after lift-off as planned, prompting an eruption of applause from ground control teams. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was aware \\\\\\\"an anomaly occurred\\\\\\\" during the SpaceX mission. \\\\\\\"The FAA briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling. Normal operations have resumed,\\\\\\\" it said in a statement. It comes a day after a SpaceX rocket blasted off from Florida carrying two privately constructed lunar landers and a micro rover to the Moon. The uncrewed Falcon 9 launched from the Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday. And Bezos' Blue Origin companysuccessfully launched a rocket into orbitfor the first time. It was a huge step forward for Bezos and his company that has spent years getting to the point of sending a rocket into orbit.\\\",\\n    \\\"images\\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dd85/live/99f40c50-d468-11ef-bb39-2f9033d1ecc6.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"The SpaceX 'Starship' rocket takes off from the company's Starbase facility in Texas\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"EPA The SpaceX 'Starship' rocket takes off from the company's Starbase facility in Texas, USA.\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aafb/live/12d55150-d465-11ef-8ff3-1b4b69bcc516.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Donald Trump's presidential portrait. \\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/562c/live/ca938990-42c2-11ef-9b76-575d2882794d.png.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Black and white photo of Vance at microphone in front of stars and stripes\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6e81/live/4f5f5df0-d410-11ef-9fd6-0be88a764111.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Remains of houses burned by wildfires in Los Angeles\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6e6d/live/17bddaa0-d45d-11ef-a777-d1a42f055885.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Donald Trump and Sylvester Stallone clasp each other's hands on stage at a gala at Mar-a-Lago in November 2024 \\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/493dc650-d442-11ef-93ce-574f8f93dcfa.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Two cans of Zyn on a table, one of them open.

Netanyahu had delayed a cabinet vote to approve the Gaza ceasefire deal, due on Thursday, accusing Hamas of seeking last-minute changes to the agreement. On Friday morning his office said Netanyahu had been informed by the negotiating team that agreements on the deal had been reached. He has ordered the political-security cabinet to convene later on Friday and the government \\\\\\\"will then convene to approve the deal\\\\\\\", Netanyahu's office said. Families of the hostages have been informed, it added. Representatives of Israel, Hamas, the United States, and Qatar have officially signed the deal in Doha, Israeli media reports. The ceasefire dealwas first announced on Wednesdayby mediators the US and Qatar. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani said the agreement would come into effect on Sunday, pending Israeli cabinet approval. At the time, Netanyahu said the deal's final details were still being worked on, but he thanked Biden for \\\\\\\"promoting\\\\\\\" it. Netanyahu then delayed a cabinet vote to approve the deal on Thursday, accusing Hamas of trying to \\\\\\\"extort last minute concessions\\\\\\\". Hamas said it was committed to the deal, but the BBC understands it was trying to add some of its members to the list of Palestinian prisoners that would be released under the deal. Although Israeli negotiators have agreed to the deal, which follows months of talks, it cannot be implemented until it is approved by the security cabinet and government. The country's security cabinet and then the government will now need to meet to ratify the agreement. Two hardline right-wing ministers, Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who both oppose the deal, have said they will resign in protest. But they've signalled they will not join the opposition - to bring the government down - yet, so long as the war resumes in six weeks time, when phase one of the ceasefire and hostage release deal ends. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has said he expects the ceasefire to start on Sunday as planned with the release of the first three Israeli hostages. Many Palestinians and Israeli hostages' families celebrated news of the ceasefire after it was first announced. But there was no let up in the war on the ground in Gaza, with Israeli strikes killing more than 80 people since the deal was announced, the Hamas-run health ministry said. Strikes were carried out on 50 targets in Gaza since the deal's announcement, the Israel Defense Forces and the Israeli Security Agency said on Thursday.  The first six-week phase of the deal would see 33 hostages - including women, children and elderly people - exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israeli troops would also withdraw to the east, away from densely populated areas of Gaza. Displaced Palestinians would be able to start returning to their homes and hundreds of aid lorries would be allowed entry to the territory each day. Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and a return to \\\\\\\"sustainable calm\\\\\\\" - would start on the 16th day. The third and final stage would involve the return of any remaining hostages' bodies and the reconstruction of Gaza - something which could take years. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and others - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 46,788 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million population has also been displaced, there is widespread destruction and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter, while aid agencies struggle to get help to those in need. Israel says 94 of the hostages are still being held by Hamas, 34 of whom are presumed dead. There are four Israelis who were abducted before the war, two of whom are dead.\\\",\\n    \\\"images\\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a5cb/live/ad7dcf50-d48f-11ef-89cc-ff703c31a434.png.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"The first six-week phase of the deal would see 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for Palestinian prisoners\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Reuters A woman holds a sign with the image of a hostage kidnapped during the 7 October attacks.",

If he wins, the 59-year-old will succeed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and lead the country into the next general election, which will take place this year. Earlier this month, Trudeau announced his intent to resign after nine years in office once a new Liberal leader is selected. At Thursday's announcement, Mr Carney sought to ground himself to his Canadian roots and distinguish himself from both Trudeau and his opponents across the political aisle. While he has recently served as an economic advisor to Trudeau, Mr Carney is the only candidate in the Liberal Party's leadership race who is not an elected member of Trudeau's government. He has branded himself as an outsider who brings a wealth of financial knowledge to a country that is struggling with a sluggish economy. Under Liberal Party rules, any member of the party - including those who are not elected officials - can run for leadership. They are expected to seek a seat in parliament in the next election, however, which Mr Carney said he intends to do. In his pitch to Canadians, Mr Carney outlined challenges facing the country, like a housing affordability crisis, stagnant wages and the threat of climate change. \\\\\\\"Too many people are falling behind,\\\\\\\" he said. He also noted the tariff threat from US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday, saying that Canada is facing extraordinary times. Trump has suggested imposing potential 25% tariffs on Canadian goods. \\\\\\\"I've helped managed multiple crises and I've helped save two economies,\\\\\\\" Mr Carney said. \\\\\\\"I know how business works, and I know how to make it work for you.\\\\\\\" Mr Carney, who is Harvard and Oxford educated, brings a range of economic experience to the race. He previously worked at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, and served as Canada's central banker, from 2008 - when the country became the first G7 nation to raise interest rates after the financial crisis - to 2013. He then moved to London, where he served as governor of the Bank of England until 2020. During his tenure, he led efforts to support the UK economy through Brexit, though he faced criticism that some of his early interventions were overly political. Mr Carney is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 became a UN Special Envoy for Climate Change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change. In recent months, Mr Carney advised Trudeau on economic matters. On Thursday, he criticised the sitting prime minister for his handling of the file. \\\\\\\"I know I'm not the only Liberal in Canada who believes that the prime minister and his team let their attention wander from the economy too often,\\\\\\\" Mr Carney said. Mr Carney's opponents in the Liberal leadership race include a number of sitting members of parliament. Former finance minister Chrystia Freeland is also expected to announce a bid in the coming days. Freeland resigned from her post in December over a break from Trudeau for his handling of Canada's fiscal matters. Whoever wins the Liberal leadership race will face-off against the opposition Conservatives, who have a strong lead in the polls. Their leader, Pierre Poilievre, has championed a small government and a return to \\\\\\\"common sense\\\\\\\" politics. Mr Carney called Poilievre's ideas for Canada \\\\\\\"naïve\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"dangerous\\\\\\\". The Conservatives have sought to link Mr Carney with Trudeau's unpopular government, saying he is \\\\\\\"just like Justin\\\\\\\". They also note he has been a champion of carbon pricing, which is Trudeau's signature climate policy and has been met with a mixed reaction in Canada. Mr Carney has advocated for a price on carbon, but appeared to recently back away from the policy, telling a Senate committee in May that it has \\\\\\\"served a purpose up until now\\\\\\\". On Thursday, he said that the carbon tax should be replaced with a policy \\\\\\\"that is at least, if not more, effective\\\\\\\" on climate without hurting Canadians' bottom line. Liberals are scheduled to elect their next leader on 9 March. The next Canadian general election must be held on or before October of this year, and could come as early as this spring.\\\",\\n    \\\"images\\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2675/live/52d05fa0-d44e-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Reuters Former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney stands before a podium with a crowd and a Canadian flag in the background.

It comes afterLively filed a legal complaintagainst Baldoni in December, alleging sexual harassment and that he had campaigned to \\\\\\\"destroy\\\\\\\" her reputation. Now, Baldoni has responded by suing for $400m (£326m) damages on claims of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy, according to US media. Representatives for Lively, Reynolds and their publicist, who is also named in the case, are yet to respond to Baldoni's lawsuit. In the latest step in their bitter legal battle, lawyers for Baldoni, 40, has claimed Lively and her team made a \\\\\\\"duplicitous attempt to destroy\\\\\\\" him. His attorney Bryan Freedman said the actress and her partners had disseminated \\\\\\\"grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media\\\\\\\". He also said Lively and her team had \\\\\\\"attempted to bulldoze reputations and livelihoods for heinously selfish reasons\\\\\\\". The dispute stems from the production of It Ends With Us, which was adapted from a novel about domestic abuse by Colleen Hoover. Released last August, the film was a box office success, bringing in more than $350m (£280m) globally. But it appeared on the press tour that all was not well between the co-stars, who were not pictured on the red carpet together during the premiere in New York, with Baldoni skipping one in London altogether. Four months after the film's launch, Lively filed a legal complaint against Baldoni, accusing him and the boss of his studio Wayfarer of sexual harassment plus \\\\\\\"other disturbing behaviour\\\\\\\" and a \\\\\\\"hostile work environment\\\\\\\" on set. Lively's complaint went further, claiming that Baldoni and his crisis management team had deliberately set out to ruin her reputation online. Baldoni's legal team told the BBC at the time the allegations were \\\\\\\"categorically false\\\\\\\", and said they hired a crisis manager because Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met. Now, Baldoni is alleging in his 179-page complaint that he is not at fault, and that the high-profile battle is \\\\\\\"not a case about celebrities sniping at each other in the press\\\\\\\". \\\\\\\"When plaintiffs have their day in court, the jury will recognise that even the most powerful celebrity cannot bend the truth to her will,\\\\\\\" it said.\\\",\\n    \\\"images\\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c064/live/8d0146f0-d42e-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"Justin Baldoni claims Blake Lively and her team made a \\\\\\\"duplicitous attempt to destroy\\\\\\\" him\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Getty Images Picture of Justin Baldoni smiling\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c8c5/live/25f357a0-d433-11ef-9fd6-0be88a764111.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"Blake Lively posed for photos on the red carpet with her husband Ryan Reynolds and co-star Brandon Sklenar, but not Justin Baldoni\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Getty Images Three people - Brandon Sklenar, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds - are dressed in formal attire and posing for a photo.

She has since told a popular French YouTube show that she was not \\\\\\\"crazy or a moron\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"I just got played, I admit it, and that's why I came forward, because I am not the only one.\\\\\\\" A representative for Pitt told US outlet Entertainment Weekly that it was \\\\\\\"awful that scammers take advantage of fans' strong connection with celebrities\\\\\\\" and that people shouldn't respond to unsolicited online outreach \\\\\\\"especially from actors who have no social media presence.\\\\\\\" Hundreds of social media users mocked Anne, who the programme said had lost her life's savings and tried to take her own life three times since the scam came to light. Netflix France put out a post on X advertising \\\\\\\"four films with Brad Pitt (for real)\\\\\\\", while, in a now-deleted post, Toulouse FC said: \\\\\\\"Hi Anne, Brad told us he would be at the stadium on Wednesday... and you?\\\\\\\" The club has since apologised for the post. On Tuesday, TF1 said it had pulled the segment on Anne after her testimony had sparked \\\\\\\"a wave of harassment\\\\\\\" - although the programme can still be found online. In the report, Anne said her ordeal began when she downloaded Instagram in February 2023, when she was still married to a wealthy entrepreneur. She was immediately contacted by someone who said they were Pitt's mother, Jane Etta, who told Anne her son \\\\\\\"needed a woman just like her\\\\\\\". Somebody purporting to be Pitt got in touch the next day, which set off alarm bells for Anne. \\\\\\\"But as someone who isn't very used to social media, I didn't really know what was happening to me,\\\\\\\" she said. At one point, \\\\\\\"Brad Pitt\\\\\\\" said he tried to send her luxury gifts but that he was unable to pay customs on them as his bank accounts were frozendue to his divorce proceedings with actor Angelina Jolie, prompting Anne to transfer €9000 to the scammers. \\\\\\\"Like a fool, I paid... Every time I doubted him, he managed to dissipate my doubts,\\\\\\\" she said. The requests for money ramped up when the fake Pitt told Anne he needed cash to pay for kidney cancer treatment, sending her multiple AI-generated photos of Brad Pitt in a hospital bed. \\\\\\\"I looked those photos up on the internet but couldn't find them so I thought that meant he had taken those selfies just for me,\\\\\\\" she said. Meanwhile, Anne and her husband divorced, and she was awarded €775,000 - all of which went to the scammers. \\\\\\\"I told myself I was maybe saving a man's life,\\\\\\\" Anne said, who is in cancer remission herself. Anne's daughter, now 22, told TF1 she tried to \\\\\\\"get her mother to see reason\\\\\\\" for over a year but that her mother was too excited. \\\\\\\"It hurt to see how naive she was being,\\\\\\\" she said.

When images appeared in gossip magazines showing the real Brad Pitt with his new girlfriend Ines de Ramon, awakening suspicions in Anne, the scammers sent her an fake news report in which the AI-generated anchor talked about Pitt's \\\\\\\"exclusive relationship with one special individual... who goes by the name of Anne.\\\\\\\" The video comforted Anne for a short time, but when the real Brad Pitt and Ines de Ramon made their relationship official in June 2024, Anne decided to end things. After scammers tried to get more money out of her under the guise of \\\\\\\"Special FBI Agent John Smith,\\\\\\\" Anne contacted the police. An investigation is now under way. The TF1 programme said the events left Anne broke, and that she has tried to end her life three times. \\\\\\\"Why was I chosen to be hurt this way?,\\\\\\\" a tearful Anne said. \\\\\\\"These people deserve hell. We need to find those scammers, I beg you - please help me find them.\\\\\\\" But in the YouTube interview on Tuesday Anne hit back at TF1, saying it had left out details on her repeated doubts over whether she was talking to the real Brad Pitt, and added that anyone could've fallen for the scam if they were told \\\\\\\"words that you never heard from your own husband.\\\\\\\" Anne said she was now living with a friend: \\\\\\\"My whole life is a small room with some boxes. That's all I have left.\\\\\\\" While many online users overwhelmingly mocked Anne, several took her side. \\\\\\\"I understand the comic effect but we're talking about a woman in her 50s who got conned by deepfakes and AI which your parents and grandparents would be incapable to spot,\\\\\\\" one popular post on X read. An op-ed in newspaper Libération said Anne was a \\\\\\\"whistleblower\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Life today is paved with cybertraps... and AI progress will only worsen this scenario.\\\\\\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"images\\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/56c8/live/ceeb0b50-d366-11ef-9159-33fc6bbd8ac5.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"It's awful that scammers take advantage of fans' strong connection with celebrities,\\\\\\\" a spokesperson for Brad Pitt said.\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Getty Images A headshot of Brad Pitt\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/82d8/live/2dccf420-\",\n    \"chunk_order_index\": 0,\n    \"full_doc_id\": \"doc-3fc05e3a760bdfea253e473b1fa32282\"\n  },\n  \"chunk-fc81e123613447558186a76f9e2781e8\": {\n    \"tokens\": 499,\n    \"content\": \"0b50-d366-11ef-9159-33fc6bbd8ac5.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"It's awful that scammers take advantage of fans' strong connection with celebrities,\\\\\\\" a spokesperson for Brad Pitt said.\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Getty Images A headshot of Brad Pitt\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/82d8/live/2dccf420-ccdd-11ef-9f81-4d65801d86b1.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"A girl entering a CT scanning machine\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0229/live/240128f0-d451-11ef-9648-d100815d1dd7.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"Apple iPhone 16 is seen in the store in Krakow, Poland on September 26, 2024\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2f2b/live/569cb750-d345-11ef-a669-f140c338bce3.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"A programmer sits at their desk with multiple computer screens.\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c428/live/bbdb2d10-d35c-11ef-ba66-fb87e0c7f3ad.jpg.webp\\\",\\n            \\\"caption\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"altText\\\": \\\"A man with grey hair and a grey beard wearing a tartan suit and smiling at the camera.

    "content": "{\n    \"title\": \"Ukraine launches largest attack of war so far, Kyiv claims\",\n    \"text\": \"Ukraine struck several targets deep inside Russia on Tuesday in what it says is its \\\"most massive\\\" attack of the war so far. Ammunition depots and chemical plants were hit across several regions, some of which were hundreds of kilometres from the border, according to the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces. Sources in Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency told the BBC the overnight attack was a \\\"painful blow\\\" to Russia's ability to wage war. Russia said it had shot downUS-supplied Atacms missilesas well as UK-made Storm Shadow cruise missiles, and vowed to respond to the attack. At least nine airports in central and western Russia temporarily halted traffic, while the strikes prompted schools in the southwestern Saratov region to close. Strikes in the border region of Bryansk caused explosions at a refinery, ammunition depots and a chemical plant said to produce gunpowder and explosives, a Ukrainian security source told the BBC. But Kyiv also struck far deeper into the country, with the General Staff claiming to have hit targets up to 1,100km (700 miles) from the border. In the western region of Saratov, officials reported a \\\"massive\\\" drone attack. Two industrial plants in the cities of Engels and Saratov were damaged, regional governor Roman Busargin wrote on Telegram. Students were taught online on Tuesday after local schools were closed. Last week, Kyiv said it had struck an oil storage facility in Engels - prompting a days-long effort to tackle the blaze and Busargin to declare a state of emergency. Officials in the western region of Tula also reported an overnight attack, where regional governor Dmitry Milyaev Russian said air defences had shot down 16 drones. There were no casualties, he said, although falling debris had damaged some cars and buildings. Elsewhere, a gas storage site near Kazan was struck in a drone attack in the southwestern region of Tatarstan, local officials said, without reporting any casualties. Ukraine said Russia also launched dozens of drones across Ukraine overnight, with multiple air raid alerts in and around Kyiv. According to its tally, all but one were shot down or lost. Some were dummy, or decoy, drones – used to try to overwhelm air defences. As air raid alarms sounded over Kyiv last night, one drone flew back and forth for some time, its movement tracked on various Telegram groups. One user joked that it had been a \\\"great idea\\\" to send troops from the air force – who operate the air defence systems - to the front line as infantry. Today, the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper quoted a source saying more than 5,000 troops were to be transferred from air to ground forces, following an order by General Oleksandr Syrskyi. The acting commander of the Air Force responded by insisting that specialists \\\"who are objectively difficult to replace\\\" would not be moved, especially those trained on foreign-supplied weaponry and equipment. That presumably includes F16 planes and Patriot air defence systems. The General Staff also commented, conceding that the situation on the frontline \\\"is not easy\\\" with a shortage of infantry \\\"in many areas.\\\" \\\"The decision to strengthen the ground brigades on the front line at the expense of servicemen from units of other types and branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is a forced step of the military leadership to strengthen our defence,\\\" a statement read. It was, Ukraine says, a fiery night in Russia. Videos posted online seem to confirm at least some of the claims – although the defence ministry in Moscow says US- and British-made missiles were shot down over Bryansk and the Black Sea. The BBC asked Ukraine's General Staff to comment on Russian claims that they shot down 14 of these Western-made missiles overnight. A spokesman, Bohdan Senyk, said his office had \\\"no knowledge of the information you are asking about\\\". Ukraine is trying to push back, however it can, against Russian military advances on the ground, with a week to go until President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. The authorities in Kyiv have come under pressure from the US administration to lower the conscription age and enable it to send more soldiers to the frontlines. Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz recently told ABC News that Ukraine should address its shortage of troops and needed to be \\\"all in for democracy\\\" if it wants the US to be \\\"all in\\\" for Ukraine. They were stark words, given the immense price Ukraine has already paid to defend itself and Nato's eastern flank, and they seemed to herald a change of tone from Washington as Trump returns to the White House. On Tuesday in Kyiv, Zelensky said again that there was no point lowering the age of conscription from 25 to 18 when those Ukrainian troops already deployed are short on weapons. \\\"We have more than 100 brigades on the battlefield, and each of them requires daily replenishment and equipment,\\\" Zelensky said. Kyiv often claims its allies are slow to send the weapons it has promised, including air defence systems and missiles. Trump has said he ispreparing to meet Vladimir Putin upon his return to the White House– and to make ending the war in Ukraine a priority. He has not made clear how he plans to do that.\",\n    \"images\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/619d/live/60808d70-d31b-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg.webp\",\n            \"caption\": \"Ukraine claims the attack was its \\\"most massive\\\" of the war so far (file photo)\",\n            \"altText\": \"White Sands Missile Range Public Affairs An early version of the Army Tactical Missile System (Atacms) is launched in 2021.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url",
